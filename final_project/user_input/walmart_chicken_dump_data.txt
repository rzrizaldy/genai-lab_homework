WWalmart Chicken Drumsticks Reviews
Page 1 (reviews 1-10):
Aug 18, 2025 anonymous - 5 out of 5 stars - We only buy Perdue!!! And only at Walmart! We love our Perdue! We will not buy any other brand of chicken! The flavor is the best and it’s always fresh. My favorite for the chicken drumsticks is to make my own home made bone broth. So easy! Throw and entire pkg. of family size drumsticks (skin on) into a crock pot. Cover with water until about 1/2 in. above the chicken. Cook on low for 12 hrs. I usually do mine overnight. And there you go! You not only have a drinkable broth (add salt and pepper to taste after it’s cooked), but you can also use it for soups and gravy. Then I use the chicken for various dishes like chicken salad, warm chicken toasted sandwich and even for the soup. You truly can’t beat the price of what you get from one package as far as meals go. Walmart’s prices beat all the grocery stores in our area for the Perdue Family Size Drumsticks.
Jul 19, 2025 joanne - 5 out of 5 stars - refund request: I had an issue with the cheese slices that I bought and I sent her a request for a refund but haven’t heard anything back on it yet the problem was the cheese was sticking so badly to the plastic wrappers couldn’t get the cheese out of the wrapper. the refund was for $2.48
Jul 15, 2025 Germ - 5 out of 5 stars - Perdue drumstickas are a must in every fridge! These Perdue drumsticks are a regular in our household; large quantity, easy preparation, tender results. Great for soups, stews or fried if you prefer crunch. Perdue’s products are great, no antibiotics!
Jul 13, 2025 Her - 3 out of 5 stars - Ground turkey is much better than ground beef ground turkey is not greasy like ground beef for me with the chicken legs, they were just a little too big other than that they’re fine
Aug 21, 2025 Kimberly - 5 out of 5 stars - I love this option to be able to shop online. I have a disability that makes it difficult for me to go into the store. it’s so quick and easy to do and very convenient
Jul 4, 2025 Gertrude - 5 out of 5 stars - Perdue Fresh Chicken Drumsticks Value Pack I always try to get Perdue chicken of all kinds since they do not use antibiotics for their chickens. The meat of the chicken parts are tasty and easy to cook with enough protein and low calories for my meals.
May 2, 2025 Sheila - 5 out of 5 stars - love the delivery people, everyone that has come to my home has been so helpful and kind. They go the extra mile to help me and it is very appreciated. Today I ordered Dukes mayo and it was not in my order (I do home delivery so that I am not able to go to the store.) so I need to spend more money just to get a jar of mayo…
May 2, 2025 Nancy - 5 out of 5 stars - We ordered 1 whole chicken, 1 fried chicken and 1 chicken drumsticks and only received the fried chicken. With the chicken drumsticks we also got chopped meat (hamburger?) Or pork or both. The 2 items showed up on the receipt. The chicken drumsticks and the chopped meat and or pork. We don’t eat pork. I am very very disappointed with this visit. We also ordered 15 bananas and only received 4. I blame all this to everyone working in the meat department!
Mar 8, 2025 Mac - 3 out of 5 stars - Too much money for not enough chicken legs. I requested a two pack replacement and ended up buying 1. I won’t do that again.
Feb 28, 2025 Patricia - 5 out of 5 stars - I really liked getting this chicken. It cost $10.36, weighed 5.4 pounds and my wife cut it up into serving pieces (extra small pieces for our cats). The price is reasonable, the chicken was tasty and tender.
Feb 3, 2025 Mack - 4 out of 5 stars - I have been shopping at Walmart for years. The value and quality of the products are an awesome combination. I’ve no complaints.

This chicken was not cleaned properly. It had lots of feathers on it. The label said it was inspected but I highly doubt it. I will not buy again.

5.0,the United States,"November 5, 2025",Love these Jeans! Super cute and on-trend!,Black1,Large,True,"Our 17-year-old is fully into the oversized jeans trend (wooo, 90’s style here we come!). He wanted these and absolutely loves them. They fit perfectly — well, perfectly for oversized 🤔. Great quality and totally on-trend.",baggy_jeans
5.0,the United States,"June 1, 2025",Really great,Blue1,Medium,True,"Love these Jeans! I got the size Med, I’m 5'1"" 128lbs. I normally wear a 28-30 waist, so they are just a little loose on my waist, but I hope they will tighten up and shrink in a hot wash and hot dryer. These are very hip-hop, cool-girl jeans. They are very loose fitting everywhere and are not a stretch denim. They are high-waisted. The jeans have cute metal rivets on the pockets and thank god there is no dumb logo on the pocket (or I would have sent em back). Jeans are a dark'ish navy blue and a nice med-weight denim, not stiff. Because I am short I will need to cut a lot off the bottom. Keep in mind if you do cut a lot off the bottom they may loose their barrel leg shape.
Measurements for the Med. I was sent:
Jeans Front inseam -13""
Jeans Back inseam -16""
Jeans waist -34""
Jeans length from top of waistband to bottom - 44""",baggy_jeans
4.0,the United States,"October 26, 2025",Good jeans,Black1,X-Large,True,"Got mine a size up on purpose for extra sag. Good yellow stitches, shaped just like the ad pic. Keep in mind these are inexpensive so the material is nothing special, quite thin.
Big pockets! Very roomy.",baggy_jeans
5.0,the United States,"July 15, 2025",Good quality!,Blue1,Small,True,I know these Jeans seem kind of sketch but I think they’re really high quality. They sit nicely on your waist and the baggy fit is what I wanted. It was still a bit too big on me and I am 5’4 and 125 pounds so I went from a small to extra small. I would buy these pants again. The only thing I don’t like is they claim to have a newer brand that doesn’t have the yellow embroidery but mine did. It doesn’t bother me that much but maybe for others it does.,baggy_jeans

Report",baggy_jeans
1.0,France,"August 13, 2025",problème de taille,Black1,Large,True,The jeans were four sizes smaller than the measurements on the size guide. Ordered a large. They are an extra small. The zipper did not work. They have to be returned to China which will cost more than the item. So I am stuck with a useless pair of cheap Chinese jeans.,baggy_jeans
,France,"April 27, 2025",,Black1,Small,True,"Modèle très chouette mais taille non conforme. Hélas là où il devrait mesurer 106cm de longueur, il n'en fait que 95 pour un S !! De même la taille est bien inférieure. Donc beaucoup trop court et trop petit",baggy_jeans

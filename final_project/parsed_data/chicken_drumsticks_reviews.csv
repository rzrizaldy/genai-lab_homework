"Aug 18, 2025",anonymous,5,We only buy Perdue!!! And only at Walmart! We love our Perdu,"We only buy Perdue!!! And only at Walmart! We love our Perdue! We will not buy any other brand of chicken! The flavor is the best and it’s always fresh. My favorite for the chicken drumsticks is to make my own home made bone broth. So easy! Throw and entire pkg. of family size drumsticks (skin on) into a crock pot. Cover with water until about 1/2 in. above the chicken. Cook on low for 12 hrs. I usually do mine overnight. And there you go! You not only have a drinkable broth (add salt and pepper to taste after it’s cooked), but you can also use it for soups and gravy. Then I use the chicken for various dishes like chicken salad, warm chicken toasted sandwich and even for the soup. You truly can’t beat the price of what you get from one package as far as meals go. Walmart’s prices beat all the grocery stores in our area for the Perdue Family Size Drumsticks.",United States,True,chicken_drumsticks

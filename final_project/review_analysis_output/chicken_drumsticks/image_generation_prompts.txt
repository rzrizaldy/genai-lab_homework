PROMPT 1: Create an image of a pack of fresh chicken drumsticks displayed on a wooden kitchen counter. The drumsticks should appear plump and juicy, showcasing a rich brown color with slight sheen, while some pieces may have a hint of greyish tones that indicate potential quality concerns. Include a few feathers scattered nearby to reflect customer feedback on processing quality, and incorporate a rustic backdrop to enhance the home-cooked feel.

PROMPT 2: Illustrate a family-friendly kitchen scene featuring a plate of cooked chicken drumsticks, beautifully glazed and golden brown, served alongside fresh vegetables. The chicken should look tender, juicy, and appetizing, with the textures of the meat clearly visible. Add a nice size packet of raw chicken in the background, indicating its appealing packaging, and ensure the overall warm lighting conveys a comforting and inviting atmosphere.

PROMPT 3: Design an artistic composition that highlights a variety of fresh chicken products in an elegant grocery display. Showcase the chicken drumsticks and chopped meat with a focus on their textures, emphasizing the smooth surfaces and natural colors ranging from light browns to deeper shades. Incorporate elements of packaging that suggest convenience, such as neatly arranged family-size packets, and use a clean, modern aesthetic to reflect quality and freshness.

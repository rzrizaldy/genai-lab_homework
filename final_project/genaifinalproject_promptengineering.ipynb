      "  \"summary\": \"Customer perception of the COSRX Vitamin E Vitalizing Sunscreen SPF 50 is generally positive, especially praising its lack of white cast, hydrating properties, and suitability for sensitive and dry skin. Many users appreciate its lightweight texture and compatibility with makeup, as well as the added skincare benefits like Vitamin E. However, there are notable concerns about eye irritation if the product gets too close to the eyes, a greasy or oily finish that may not suit oily skin types, and a scent that some find strong or unpleasant. Some users also mention the sunscreen’s thick texture and small bottle size as drawbacks. Overall, it is regarded as an effective and pleasant sunscreen with minor issues that vary depending on individual skin type and preferences.\"\n",

(In other words, gift-givers were asked about a birthday gift they recently gave, while gift-recipients were asked about a birthday gift they recently received.)

      "Every day, millions of shoppers hit the stores in full force—both online and on foot—searching frantically for the perfect gift. . . .

      "With this paragraph, Stanford University Graduate School of Business researchers Francis J. Flynn and Gabrielle S. Adams introduce their study “Money Can’t Buy Love: Asymmetric Beliefs About Gift Price and Feelings of Appreciation,” published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 45, 2009). The researchers investigated the relationship between the price paid for a gift and the level of appreciation felt by the recipient. Gift-givers who spend more money on a gift often do so to send a strong signal of their love to the recipient. The researchers theorized that these gift-givers would expect the recipient to express a high level of appreciation for the gift. However, the researchers did not expect gift-recipients to associate a greater level of appreciation with a higher gift price. That is, “The link between gift price and feelings of appreciation will be stronger for gift-givers than for gift-recipients.”\n",

private university incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of \\nPennsylvania. Its first purpose, as stated in its Articles of Incorporation, is: \\n\\\"...the establishment and maintenance in the City of Pittsburg h of a coeducational university of \\nhigher education, including an institute of technology, emphasizing liberal -professional \\neducation and specializing in teaching and research programs in selected areas of importance to the community and to the nation.\\\" \\nMore specifically, Carnegie Mellon seeks to provide education of the highest quality so that all \\nstudents will be prepared to achieve their potential as professional persons and as thoughtful, well- informed individuals. In addition, the university encourages and supports scholarship, \\nresearch and artistic production, both as essential components of its educational program and in fulfillment of the special role of an academic institution as a source of new knowledge and understanding. Through scholarship, rese arch and the men and women it educates, the \\nuniversity contributes to social progress. \\nAs a private university, Carnegie Mellon is free to set its own measures of excellence and to determine its own educational objectives. By carefully exercising the freedom to select limited areas for university effort, it can preserve its ability to be innovative and creative in response to the changing needs of society. In order to maintain this independence and flexibility, Carnegie Mellon depends upon the voluntary support of the society which it serves. It depends especially for its funds upon students and their families, alumni, trustees, foundations, corporations, \\ngovernment and friends. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that the goals of the university be clear and that the standards and procedures for the conduct of its affairs be well understood by all of its constituents, both on and off campus. These appear in detail in the duly promulgated regulations of the university, particularly in the catalogs, the Stude nt Handbook and the Faculty \\nHandbook. \\nAcademic and Individual Freedom \\nWithin the academic community, trustees, administrators, faculty, students and staff share the responsibility for achievement of the goals of the university. Responsibilities specific to various groups are discussed in the sections which follow. Especially important, however, are the responsibilities pertaining to academic and individual freedom. An academic community is uniquely suited to its educational and s cholarly purposes primarily because of its firm \\ncommitment to intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and expression, respect for the dignity of each individual and because of its receptiveness to constructive change. \\n10 \\n \\n The commitment to academic and individual freedom carries with it major responsibilities for all \\nmembers of the university. In exercising their own freedoms, they must respect the rights of others. In seeking innovation, they must recognize that constructive change can be affected at a university only through orderly and rational processes. Intentional acts threatening personal safety, malicious destruction of property or willful and substantial disruption of university functions have no place in an academic community and will not be tol erated. It is the \\nresponsibility of all members of the academic community to maintain an atmosphere in which such violations of rights are unlikely to occur and to develop processes which assure the protection of these rights for all persons. \\nBoard of Trus tees \\nThe trustees bear ultimate responsibility for the university, its policies, organization, financing and governance. Two direct responsibilities are the supervision of the university's finances and the appointment of the president as chief executive of ficer. The operating \\nresponsibilities and the authority to act are delegated to the president; and it is primarily through the president that the trustees monitor the university's activities. \\nAdministration \\nThe administrative officers are formally responsible for supervising the programs and enforcing the policies of the university, for assessing the effects of policy and for recommending improvements or changes where appropriate. The president is the chief \\nexecutive officer of the university. In the operat ion of the university, the president delegates \\nresponsibility to provost, vice presidents, deans, directors and department heads and to \\nvarious councils and committees, which may include faculty, students and staff . \\nIt is the duty of the administrative off icers of the university to maintain a campus climate \\nwhich enhances the freedom of the faculty to teach, to engage in research and to take part in other scholarly and artistic activities, and the freedom of the students to learn and grow both inside and ou tside of the classroom . \\nFaculty \\nThe faculty has the primary responsibility for carrying out the educational and scholarly programs of the university . \\nAll members of the faculty have the duty to conduct their courses in a manner consistent with the highest standards of their profession. Through the presentation of material in the \\n11 \\n \\n classroom, they should strive to advance the art of teaching. One of the primary goals should \\nbe to instill in their students a desire to learn and an enthusiasm for the subject matter at hand. The faculty as a whole also has the major responsibility for establishing and maintaining curricula which meet the standards and fulfill the educational goals of the university. \\nStudents \\nCarnegie Mellon, as a private university, selects from among its applicants those students who have demonstrated the qualifications for achieving professional competence in one of the fields in which the university offers instruction. Any student who meets its standards is welcome to apply for admission and, if admitted, to remain at the university so long as he or she abides by its rules . \\nAdvisory Boards \\nEach academic department and school at Carnegie Mellon, as well as some non -academic \\nunits, has an advisory board whose purpose is to assist the department and the university more effectively to carry out their mission. An advisory board may use any appropriate \\nmeans to achieve this purpose, important among which are evaluating the department's goals and directions and providing information and advice to the president, provost, deans and department heads . \\nStatement on Academic Integrity \\nThe Statement on Academic Integrity, found in the faculty, student and staff handbooks, is the first step in Carnegie Mellon University's ongoing effort to identify and implement the kind of society its members wish to enjoy. \\nThis statement will be followed by implementation strategies as the Task Force on Academic \\nIntegrity continues its work. \\nPlease visit the Academic Integrity website\\n for additional information and resources. \\nStatement on Academic Integrity \\nCarnegie Mellon is a self -governing institution that requires ethical behavior of its \\nadministration, faculty, staff and students that goes beyond simple compliance with the law. Respect for these requirements creates a moral authority for the university to insist upon \\n12 \\n \\n appropriate behavior. This authority is essential to the accomplishment of the university's \\nmission. Integrity as described in this statement is a defining feature of the university community's high expectations for the conduct of its members . \\nIntroduction \\nCarnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Me llon strives to serve the \\nchanging needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: \\nto create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, \\nteaching and learning and transfer to society, to s erve students by teaching them leadership \\nand problem -solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society \\nand commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open \\nto the exchange of ideas, w here discovery and ar tistic creativity can flourish. \\nThese statements provide groundwork for academic integrity that includes everyone in the Carnegie Mellon community. Our common objective is to make sure that we teach and learn with commitment, consistency, honesty and fidelity. This process involves at its core \\ninteraction between young and old, novice and expert, apprentice and master. Integrity \\nrequires that we examine the context in which we do our work. In the university communit y, \\nyoung people grow and develop their identities, which mandate that all our dealings follow and foster principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, justice and fidelity to the mission of the university. The university population is increasingly diver se, faces rapid changes in \\nknowledge and technology that have historically produced uncertainty about the appropriate roles of individuals and professions in the larger society. Each of these facts can and do create issues that we need to be aware of and d eal with if we are to successfully achieve our \\nprimary missions. When these circumstances are not fully communicated to and understood by all persons in the community, unnecessary suspicions concerning integrity may distract from our teaching and learning and taint the atmosphere on campus. When they are openly discussed and conflicts concerning them openly aired, we all proceed with greater confidence \\nand trust. \\nAll members of the university community have the obligation to serve as models of personal \\nand professional integrity, as well as models for creating, expressing and transferring knowledge. This implies that the faculty not only provide the knowledge and training that \\nprepare students to find their productive roles in society, but also help them dis cover and \\nmaintain integrity in the practice of that role. Staff and administrators are charged with \\nrepresenting the university accurately and forthrightly. Students are responsible for \\n13 \\n \\n conducting their learning in a similarly honest and committed fashion -by avoiding plagiarism, \\ncheating or taking credit for work not their own -and thus contributing to a campus \\natmosphere which expects and supports academic integrity. \\nPractice of the Mission of Academic Integrity \\nAcademic integrity refers to the implicit co mmitment that every member makes to all others \\nin the community to practice those principles that underlie the mission of the university and \\ndefine academic integrity. These are: honesty and good faith; clarity in the communication of core values; professi onal conduct of work; mutual trust and respect; and fairness and \\nexemplary behavior. \\nHonesty and Good Faith \\nUnderlying all the interactions and transactions of the university is the assumption that all of its members act in good faith and are open with eac h other. For example, students must be \\nable to assume that they can take faculty, staff and administration at their word and vice versa. If questions about honest communications and good faith arise within the community or among some of its members, the ge neral issue must be aired in a frank and open way. \\nIndividual cases involving alleged infractions, on the other hand, are properly handled under conditions that respect confidentiality. Penalties for proven infractions of the university's standards must be dealt with promptly and fairly. The more fully we can come to understand \\nand concur with one another on guiding principles, the fewer such cases will turn up, and the \\nmore rewarding the university experience will be for all of us. \\nClarity in the Communica tion of Core Values \\nClarity in the communication of the core values and standards of Carnegie Mellon requires \\nexplicit understanding of the mission and core values among members of faculty, staff, administration and students; reflection upon and open discu ssion of standards of practice; \\nidentification and resolution of conflicts posed by our mission objectives; and a clear and open communication of our mission to the community. This means we recognize our commitment to the distinct objectives of our vision and mission with all the assessment, certification, evaluation and reorientation that these imply. In direct face -to-face situations \\nstudents should be dealt with immediately, openly and honestly. Students also need opportunities to learn about and discuss standards, expectations and norms when no \\nimmediate \\\"case\\\" is at hand. \\n14 \\n \\n \\nProfessional Conduct of Work \\nProfessionalism for the faculty involves designing syllabi which accurately indicate the subject \\nmatter and practices of each course and meeting all schedu led classes fully prepared for the \\nassigned work. It also involves the certification of students in their areas of expertise. The university is obligated to provide measures of student progress in the form of grades, \\ndegrees, and honors. These attest to society that both faculty and students have fulfilled their \\ncommitments. Degrees and honors certify that a level of performance has been met in a \\nstudent's demonstration of acquisition and use of knowledge, so it is imperative that grading \\nbe a fair, accurat e and honest measure of a student's work. At the same time, faculty need to \\nbe cognizant of the pressure on students to view grades, which they see as determining their job prospects, as \\\"the be all and end all\\\" of their university experiences and to devis e \\nstrategies in the classroom to make learning, rather than receiving grades, the central focus. \\nThe ethics governing research must be understood, practiced and communicated to students. This involves being clear and truthful about the ownership of researc h results and \\ndata, avoiding conflicts of interest (or disclosing them when they cannot be avoided), and making only honest and accurate claims in reporting research. In the context of the university, the professional conduct of work has two distinct dimensions: professionalism in one's discipline or area of expertise and professionalism as a member of the university. The distinction between these aspects of professionalism in the academy must be clearly understood and communicated. In addition, each of the various academic disciplines and \\nfields of endeavor represented at Carnegie Mellon has its own implicit and explicit standards \\nfor professional work. These are binding on faculty, administration and staff, and must be communicated to students as part of their preparation to become professionals. Research ethics also entails the open discussion of the propriety of the university's involvement in work that seems to be detrimental to society given the values of our mission. \\nProfessional research in the academ y is involved with several of its unique institutional goals, \\nincluding the education of undergraduates, graduate education and certification for professional roles, and faculty tenure. These features pose issues specific to the academy, issues which must be acknowledged and treated explicitly if we are to be clear, open and consistent. The practices of other organizations may therefore not be entirely relevant to \\nthose in the university. Recognizing that students are learners demands that they be involved in ongoing research in ways which benefit their education, rather than merely as assistants in faculty projects. Students need also to be clearly informed about standards of behavior and performance that are accepted practices in the discipline and held re sponsible to them. This \\nshould be done proactively as a learning experience rather than retroactively as a punitive experience. \\n15 \\n \\n \\nMutual Trust and Respect \\nAn environment of mutual trust and respect is necessary if the institution is to promote \\nintegrity. Mut ual trust and respect are prerequisites for open communication and honest \\ndialogue about values, goals and expectations. They require freedom of expression without fear of retribution, institutional or otherwise, and value the diversity of persons, ideas a nd \\nchoices differing from one's own. They recognize that being in a diverse community is an \\nadvantage to encouraging discovery and creativity. Both respect for individuals and respect \\nfor institutional values involves balancing the claims of personal autonomy with the goals \\nand mission of the institution. All of us need to be alert to prevent the power structure of the classroom and the university as a whole from suppressing legitimate beliefs and practices. If trust should break down, we need to explore th e reasons for the breakdown and identify \\nways for the community to rebuild trust among its members. \\nA basis for promoting trust and respect is provided by ensuring that the faculty treat the student's education and the student as ends rather than as a means to some end. For example, the graduate student's development as a researcher and professional, his or her learning and well -being, have to be honored as ends in themselves, rather than treating \\ngraduate student work merely as a means to the end of the pr oduction of knowledge (from \\nwhich the professor may benefit more than the student). Students at all levels must be encouraged to value their university experience as learning and personal growth, rather than solely as the means to a career goal. They are r esponsible for rendering an atmosphere of \\nmistrust by their teachers and among themselves unnecessary by consistently living up to \\nthe university's standards. \\nFairness and Exemplary Behavior \\nThe preservation of academic integrity means not only commitment to ideals but also justice in carrying out these ideals. Faculty, staff and administration must deal fairly in all of the various decisions they make which have consequences for students and all the other stakeholders of the university. When questions aris e as to whether such decisions distribute \\nbenefits and burdens fairly, significant dialogue and open communications about such decisions should be conducted. The power that teachers wield in the classroom must be exercised with the greatest possible care f or maintaining fairness, which means examining \\nclassroom practice for any hidden assumptions which might produce confusion or partiality. It also means that we describe to students what the expected commitment for a learning environment is and how to deal with conflicts of commitment, for example time management problems, as they arise. Students must strive to be fair to each other, for example in not claiming unjustified credit in carrying out joint projects and in the appropriate \\n16 \\n \\n sharing of facilities. Staff must demonstrate impartiality in offering students information, \\nopportunities and perquisites. \\nIntegrity in the campus community is more than just swift punishment of plagiarism or cheating. It is an on- going process which asks everyone to both conside r carefully and \\npractice consistently the honesty, clear thinking, professionalism, fairness and trust that make learning, teaching and living here rewarding. When misunderstandings or conflicts over what constitutes integrity arise, as they may in a chang ing society, the campus must use the \\nopportunity to exercise impartiality and wisdom to adjudicate between ideas and parties. Rightly settled, such issues will become the basis for shared understandings in the future. The university expects its members to be leaders in matters concerning integrity, not only here, but in the larger society we serve. \\nStandards for Academic & Creative Life (Academic Policies) \\nThis section of The Word serves to highlight many policies and procedures related to academics at Car negie Mellon University. You should also become familiar with the following sources, \\nwhich are the primary documents governing academic policies: the University Policies website\\n, \\nthe Undergraduate Catalog , and individual department handbooks provided to each graduate \\nstudent. \\nAcademic Disciplinary Actions Overview \\nAcademic disciplinary actions are outcomes imposed when any student violates the University Policy on Academic Integrity\\n including cheating, plagiarism and unauthorized \\nassist ance. \\nAcademic Integrity Policy \\nStudents at Carnegie Mellon are engaged in intellectual activity consistent with the highest standards of the academy. The relationship between students and instructors and their shared commitment to overarching standards of respect, honor and transparency determine the integrity of our community of scholars. The actions of our students, faculty and staff are a representation of our university community and of the professional and personal communities that we lead. Therefore, a deep and abiding commitment to academic integrity is fundamental to a Carnegie Mellon education. Honesty and good faith, clarity in the communication of core values, professional conduct of work, mutual trust and respect, and \\n17 \\n \\n fairness and exemplary behavior represent the expectations for ethical behavior for all \\nmembers of the Carnegie Mellon community . \\nPolicy Statement \\nIn any manner of presentation, it is the responsibility of each student to produce her/his own original academic work. Collaboration or assistance on academic work to b e graded \\nis not permitted unless explicitly authorized by the course instructor(s). Students may utilize the assistance provided by the Student Academic Success Center and the Academic Resource Center (CMU -Q) unless specifically prohibited by the course in structor(s). Any \\nother sources of collaboration or assistance must be specifically authorized by the course instructor(s) . \\n In all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources is required. When collaboration or assistance is permitted by the cou rse instructor(s) or when a student \\nutilizes the services provided by the Student Academic Success Center and the Academic Resource Center (CMU -Q), the acknowledgement of any collaboration or assistance is \\nlikewise required. This citation and acknowledgeme nt must be incorporated into the work \\nsubmitted and not separately or at a later point in time. Failure to do so is dishonest and is subject to disciplinary action . \\n Instructors have a duty to communicate their expectations including those specific to collaboration, assistance, citation and acknowledgement within each course. Students \\nlikewise have a duty to ensure that they understand and abide by the standards that apply in any course or academic activity. In the absence of such understanding, it is the \\nstudent\\u2019s responsibility to seek additional information and clarification . \\nPolicy Violations \\nCheating occurs when a student avails her/himself of an unfair or disallowed advantage \\nwhich includes but is not limited to : \\n1. Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam, answer key or other graded work from \\nprevious course offerings . \\n2. Use of an alternate, stand -in or proxy during an examination. \\n3. Copying from the examination or work of another person or source . \\n4. Submission or use of falsified data . \\n5. Using false statements to obtain additional time or other accommodation . \\n18 \\n \\n 6. Falsification of academic credentials. \\nPlagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other individuals \\nwithout proper attribution or citation. Unique ideas or materials taken from an other \\nsource for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged in academic work to be \\ngraded. Examples of sources expected to be referenced include but are not limited to : \\n1. Text, either written or spoken, quoted directly or paraphrased. \\n2. Graphic elem ents. \\n3. Passages of music, existing either as sound or as notation. \\n4. Mathematical proofs. \\n5. Scientific data. \\n6. Concepts or material derived from the work, published or unpublished, of another \\nperson. \\nUnauthorized assistance refers to the use of sources of support that have not been \\nspecifically authorized in this policy statement or by the course instructor(s) in the \\ncompletion of academic work to be graded. Such sources of support may include but are not limited to advice or help provided by another individual, published or unpublished written sources, and electronic sources. Examples of unauthorized assistance include but are not limited to : \\n1. Collaboration on any assignment beyond the standards authorized by this policy \\nstatement and the course instructor(s ). \\n2. Submission of work completed or edited in whole or in part by another person. \\n3. Supplying or communicating unauthorized information or materials, including graded work and answer keys from previous course offerings, in any way to another student. \\n4. Use of unauthorized information or materials, including graded work and answer keys from previous course offerings. \\n5. Use of unauthorized devices. \\n6. Submission for credit of previously completed graded work in a second course without first obtaining permission from th e instructor(s) of the second course. In the \\ncase of concurrent courses, permission to submit the same work for credit in two courses must be obtained from the instructors of both courses. \\n19 \\n \\n \\nProcedures for dealing with allegations of these policy violations are detailed in the \\nuniversity\\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Action Procedures, which are published in The WORD \\nstudent handbook. Periodic review of these procedures will be overseen by the Dean of \\nStudent Affairs or her/his designee in consultation with Facult y Senate and the relevant \\nstudent governing bodies. Any amendments to these procedures are subject to the \\napproval of Faculty Senate. Additional guidelines and procedures for graduate students may exist at the college/department/program level, in which cas e they are communicated \\nin the college/department/program graduate student handbook . \\nAssistance for Individuals with Disabilities \\nQualified individuals are entitled to reasonable accommodations under the guidelines of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). \\nThe Office of Disability \\nResources serves as links between students with disabilities and the campus community. \\nAccommodations are determined on a case -by-case basis. In order to receive \\nservices/accommodations verification of a disability is required as recommended in writing by a doctor, licensed psychologist or psycho -educational s pecialist. All information will be \\nconsidered confidential and only released to appropriate pers onnel on a need to know basis. \\nTo access services, individuals must initiate a request in writing for specific services/accommodations (books on tape, enlargem ents, interpreters, etc.). The university \\nmakes available Summary of Accommodations memoranda for students to give to professors, which document disability and describe the accommodations. Accommodations prescribed only apply to Carnegie Mellon and may not be valid elsewhere. The individual takes full responsibility for ongoing assistance. For more information or to initiate a request for accommodations, please contact Catherine Getchell. \\nResources for Individuals with Disabilities \\nName Title Phone Email \\n Catherine \\nGetchell Director, Office of \\nDisability \\nResources 412-268-6121 getchell@cmu.edu \\nSalima Clark Accessibility \\nSpecialist 412- 268- 8285 salimac @andrew.cmu.edu \\n20 \\n \\n Patrick McCue Accessibility \\nSpecialist 412-268-7537 pmccue@andrew.cmu.edu \\n Ethan Obstarczyk Senior Disability \\nResources \\nProgram \\nAdministrator 412-268-5940 ethano@andrew.cmu.edu \\nJill Ramsey Testing Center \\nProctor 412-268-5940 jillrams@andrew.cmu.edu \\nChange of Address \\nA student is required to report all changes in address to The HUB by changing his/her \\naddress through Student Information Online (SIO). It is the student's responsibility to provide \\nEnrollment Services and the university with a current address. \\nComputing\\n Policy \\nStatement \\nThe purpose of this policy is to set forth guidelines so that members of our community may use the campus network and computing facilities in ways that are responsible and respectful of privacy. This policy sets forth the university\\u2019s expectations of acceptable behavior on the part of computer systems users at Carnegie Mellon by providing guidelines for appropriate use of computing and related communication systems and examples of inappropriate use. These standards of acceptable behavior also extend beyond the campus community into the Internet. Jus t as it is unacceptable to violate \\nothers\\u2019 rights to privacy, property and resources within Carnegie Mellon, it is also unacceptable to violate those rights on systems that are not at Carnegie Mellon but are \\naccessible through Carnegie Mellon\\u2019s connection to the Internet . \\nThis policy applies to all users of Carnegie Mellon computing systems, including students, \\nfaculty and staff, and any others granted the use of university computing resources. It applies to the use of all computing facilities owned, leased, operated or contracted by Carnegie Mellon University. As used in this policy, terms such as \\u201ccomputing,\\u201d \\u201ccomputing/communications systems,\\u201d \\u201ccomputing resources,\\u201d etc., refer to all computers, communication systems, and peripherals, software, telephones and systems with similar \\n21 \\n \\n functions, which are owned by Carnegie Mellon, or which utilize Carnegie Mellon \\ninfrastructure such as telephone lines or computer networks . \\nAlthough this policy does not attempt to deal specifically with legal issues, university members are responsible to act in compliance with the law, including any federal, state and local laws governing computer and telecommunications use, as well as all other applicable university policies . \\nPrivileges and Responsibilities \\nEvery member of the Carnegie Mellon community who uses computing and related communications systems at Carnegie Mellon, or systems that belong to Carnegie Mellon or which rely on Carnegie Mellon\\u2019s infrastructure has the responsibilities described in this policy. This includes members of the Carnegie Mellon community who have restricted \\nprivileges, such as alumni who may have electronic mail access only. Individuals with personally -owned computers, but who rely upon the university network to connect those \\ncomputers (either through an on- campus or remote network connection, such as ethernet \\nor wireless) are expected to abide by the policies set forth in this document. Personally -\\nowned computers operating in stand -alone mode or networked through a non- university \\nconnection are not covered under this policy, but those users are encouraged to consult the usage policies set forth by their Internet Service Provider . \\nA fundamental premise of this policy is that anyone sharing computing resources with other individuals should behave as a reasonable, mature and ethical person. The user must recognize that computer systems and networks do not exist in a special environment; on the contrary, use of computers is a form of communication, and every component of a computing environment and every piece of information it contains belong to the university, the university community as a whole, or some individual or group within that community. \\nAccess to Carnegie Mellon\\u2019s computing resources is contingent upon being a member of \\nthe university community and adhering to university and Computing Services policies, guidelines and procedures, including this policy. Misuse may result in the loss of access and/or university disciplinary action. For some users and certain systems, access may be authorized by sp ecific departments, research centers or other organizations affiliated with \\nCarnegie Mellon. In such cases, any department - or group -specific policies and guidelines \\nmust be adhered to when using resources provided by the department or group. This is in addition to university policies and Computing Services guidelines and procedures. \\nAny user who suspects a violation of the university\\u2019s computer use policies, or who has knowledge of potential vulnerabilities or security loopholes in a system or network at \\n22 \\n \\n Carnegie Mellon, should immediately notify the Information Security Office at iso-\\nir@andrew.cmu.edu . \\nMaintain the Security and Confidentiality of your Account \\nUsers assume person al responsibility for the use made of their computer accounts. This \\nresponsibility begins with selecting a secure password, and involves maintaining the \\nconfidentiality of that password and changing the password regularly in order to assure the continued security of your account. For guidance in selecting a secure password, see Guidelines for Password Management\\n. If you believe that someone has made \\nunauthorized use of your account, you should change your password immediately and report the incident to the \\nInformation Security Office . \\nRespect for Oth ers\\u2019 Property and Privacy Rights \\nUsers are responsible to respect copyright agreements and intellectual property ownership. Any material that is the work of another, whether explicitly copyrighted or not, should not be distributed by any user without appropriate acknowledgement and/or permission of the creator. Unless permission has been granted by the owner of copyright protected materials, distribution of copyright protected material via the university network or computer systems is prohibited. While the university has been granted \\npermission by software vendors to distribute certain software packages via the network, it is not generally permissible for individual users to distribute that same software to others via the university network or computer systems. See the sections in this policy on \\nMisuse \\nand Inappropriate Behavior . While there may be cases in which property rights to \\nparticular programs, data, etc., are ambiguous or in dispute, the user must assume that any information not created by himself or herself belongs to someone else and must respect that person\\u2019s privacy and property rights to that information. (In certain situations, even information created by the user may not belong to that user but rather to \\nthe university or others.) This policy is not intended to limit \\u201cfair use\\u201d as permitted under the Copyright Act and users having questions about whether a particular use constitutes a \\u201cfair use\\u201d may consult the Office of the General Counsel for advice. \\nImproper/Illegal Communications \\nAny communications that would be improper or illegal on any other medium are equally so on the computer: libelous material, obscene messages, harassment, forgery, threats, etc. However, t his is not intended to restrict the free expression of ideas. Communication \\nconducted in accordance with the university policy on Freedom of Expression\\n and with \\nthe statement on Academic Freedom and Responsibility enunciated in the Appointment \\nand Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon Unive r sity will not be considered a violation of this \\n23 \\n \\n policy. For further guidelines, see also the university policy on Separation of Individual\\u2019s \\nand Institution\\u2019s Interests . \\nResponsible Sharing of Resources \\nWhere a resource such as memory, CPU time or access to network resources belongs to \\nthe whole community collectively, it must be shared. \\nIt is unacceptable to make such excessive use of system or network resources that other users cannot obtain access. Examples include excessive use of CPU time during a period of heavy use on a timesharing system, excessive use of disk space on a system that do es \\nnot limit such utilization, the use of an excessive amount of network bandwidth in an environment of networked computers, and any activity that makes a system unusable or significantly degrades performance for others. A novice user might be unaware that a particular action constitutes \\u201cexcessive use\\u201d but, without doubt, once a system administrator makes him or her aware of the fact that such an action is unreasonable, that user will be held responsible for any further such infractions. If you are unsure whether your needs constitute excessive use, contact the system administrator. Similarly, if you need an unusual amount of disk space, CPU time or other resources, check with the system administrator to find out whether this use can be accommodated, rather than risk \\ninterfering with the work of others on the system. \\nRisks of Data Loss and Data Persistence \\nAlthough the university will make efforts to secure the network and university controlled servers from abuse and damage, it cannot guarantee against data loss by a student, \\nfaculty, member or staff, either on a university- operated or an individually -owned \\ncomputer. \\n Users should know that even those files that they have \\u201cdeleted\\u201d using the appropriate procedures in the application or operating system, may indeed be recoverable if they exist in a system backup file or other persistent form. If the university is asked to recover such data by subpoena, it must cooperate, and data that the user believes to have been destroyed may be recovered in the process. \\nPersonal Use \\nWhile the university makes computer resources available primarily to achieve its goals of education and research, and for administrative activities, it realizes the need to encourage the personal use of computing for the convenience of the campus community. Thus, it is reasonable to allow the use of computing resources for computer mail, document \\n24 \\n \\n preparation, personal or course Web page publication, or other activity that can facilitate \\nconvenience or enhance productivity, to the extent that the activity is within the limits \\ndescribed by Responsible Sharing of Resources . Any personal use of computing resources \\nrelated to operating a personal business or commercial enterprise is prohibited unless permission to do so has been specifically granted by the provost or the provost\\u2019s designee. \\nWe do recognize the difficulty of distinguishing whether certain cases of \\u201cpersonal use\\u201d are allowable, such as activities that result in personal financial gain (e.g. checking stock prices online), relate to a commercial business (e.g. university -sponsored technology \\ntransfer efforts), or support (but do not constitute operating) a personal business (e.g. a student developing a business pla n or a faculty member writing a report for a consulting \\nengagement outside the university). In such cases, we rely on individuals to be responsible and judicious in the use of university\\u2019s shared computing resources. In particular ensuring: \\n\\u2022 appropriate use of resources (e.g. any such work is completed outside of university \\ntime and does not utilize shared resources such as CPU cycles or network bandwidth to a degree that adversely impacts academic or research activities); \\n\\u2022 appropriate use of licenses (e.g. do not use software procured with academic use licenses for commercial applications or development, unless the license explicitly permits such use); \\n\\u2022 appropriate marketing (e.g. no creation of \\u201c.com\\u201d domains within Carnegie Mellon\\u2019s \\u201cedu\\u201d doma in, no advertising services and products using Carnegie Mellon email \\naccounts, and no advertising using web pages on Carnegie Mellon servers (any server with a .CMU.EDU host name). \\nIn cases of questionable personal use of resources, you may contact \\nit-\\nhelp@andrew.cmu.edu to determine whether a particular activity is permissible. \\nWe reserve the right to restrict personal use of university systems and networks by an \\nindividual or by the community at large, if the use of resources for such activities becomes \\nexcessive. If you need unlimited access to computer networks for private or business purposes, you can sub scribe to a commercial service. \\nFor information regarding the use of r esources to produce intellectual property and profit \\nfrom the development of such property see Carnegie Mellon University\\u2019s \\nIntellectual \\nProperty Policy and the Policy on Conflict of Interest/Commitment . \\n25 \\n \\n Privacy \\nThe user must presume that the contents of any other users\\u2019 d irectory are private unless \\nexpressly designated otherwise, just as one would presume that the contents of \\nsomeone\\u2019s apartment or office are private. The only exceptions to this rule are: that in some environments, files such as \\u201cplan files\\u201d may be conside red public even if the user \\nhas not expressly designated them as such; and that some services such as web pages \\nand anonymous or \\u201cguest access\\u201d ftp services may be considered to be public, but only for \\nthose areas not protected by password and which are \\u201co bviously\\u201d public. An unprotected \\naccount or shared device (such as a shared disk on a networked computer) are not considered to be public unless the name or service expressly indicates that it is. In such cases, any files or other data which would appear to be private in nature, by virtue of the file name or data stored, even if \\u201cpublicly accessible\\u201d should be considered to be private. The user accessing such files has a responsibility to ask the owner of the files or service if the files are intended to be publicly accessible before the user does more than a \\u201ccursory \\nglance\\u201d sufficient to cause the question. \\nA user can explicitly grant access to his or her directories, files or to services run from his or her systems. However, users who issue general or vag ue invitations to browse through \\ntheir files incur a special obligation to protect any material that they do not wish others to \\nsee. Indeed, all users are urged to maintain protection levels on their files consistent with \\nthe access they are actually willi ng to give to other users. \\nAccess to Faculty Data \\nElectronic data on a faculty member\\u2019s account, whether stored on a computer in the faculty member\\u2019s office or elsewhere under the proprietary control of that faculty member, may not be examined, i.e., the contents of the data read by a person, without the faculty member\\u2019s consent, except in cases of emergency or in response to a valid subpoena, search warrant, or order of a court. Posting of data by a faculty member on servers available to the public or to students shall be understood to imply consent, and \\nelectronic access given to specific parties by the faculty member will likewise imply \\nconsent for those parties to access permitted data. Emergencies may include, for example, but are not limited to, the death, incapacity or disappearance of the faculty member, or the search for and examination of files used for apparently malicious activity in an account which endangers the integrity of shared computers, the network, or other aspects of the university\\u2019s computing infrastructure. \\nOnly specifically designated individuals are permitted to determine what passes for an \\u201cemergency.\\u201d Such individuals may be specifically designated, or may be designated by job \\n26 \\n \\n position/description. All assignments for individuals o r positions will be done by Provost \\nor by a designate of the Provost. \\nWhenever possible and legally permissible, notification must be given to the faculty \\nmember whose data are subject to subpoena, search warrant, or order of court prior to compliance ther ewith, and, whenever possible and legally permissible, sufficient time \\nmust be allowed, before intrusion, to allow the faculty member to file a motion to quash. Information obtained from an examination warranted by an emergency cannot be used as evidence i n university sanctions of any faculty member, and cannot be released to the \\npublic, or to the university community or to public officials, except as such releases are essential to resolution of the emergency, or constitute evidence of a crime concealment o f \\nwhich would obstruct justice, and in the latter case release may only be to appropriate law enforcement officials. Any intrusion by an employee of the university into a faculty member\\u2019s electronic data must be reported to the faculty member as soon as po ssible, \\nand within five days of the event in writing both to the faculty member, if possible, and \\nunless prohibited by order of court, and to an Ombudsman, who shall be a member of \\nthe regular faculty selected annually by the Nominating Committee of the Fa culty Senate \\nand who has been endorsed by majority vote of the Faculty Senate. The Ombudsman shall be a current or retired regular faculty member who holds no administrative appointment and is not a member of the Faculty Review Committee. The Ombudsman \\nshall have authority to investigate whether an intrusion was warranted by the policy and, \\n(i) shall inform the President and the affected faculty member of the Ombudsman\\u2019s findings; (ii) where a violation of the policy is found, shall inform the Faculty Revie w \\nCommittee of the policy violation; and (iii) where appropriate, in the absence of the affected faculty member, to bring a grievance before the Faculty Review Committee. Violation of any aspect of this policy is a sanctionable offense. \\nFor purposes of thi s section, the term \\u201cfaculty\\u201d shall mean any person who is a member of \\nthe Faculty Organization as defined in Article III of the Constitution of the Faculty Organization. \\nAccess to Staff Data \\nElectronic data on a staff member\\u2019s account, whether sto red on a computer in the staff \\nmember\\u2019s office or elsewhere under the proprietary control of that staff member, may not be examined, i.e., the contents of the data read by a person, without the staff member\\u2019s consent, except in cases of emergency, in respo nse to a valid subpoena, search \\nwarrant, order of a court, or by specific request by the staff members\\u2019 supervisor for the purpose of accessing work -related electronic data. Posting of data by a staff member on \\nservers available to the public or to members of the university shall be understood to \\n27 \\n \\n imply consent, and electronic access given to specific parties by the staff member will \\nlikewise imply consent for those parties to access permitted data. Emergencies may include, for example, but are not limited t o, the death, incapacity or disappearance of the \\nstaff member, or the search for and examination of files used for apparently malicious activity in an account which endangers the integrity of shared computers, the network, or other aspects of the university\\u2019s computing infrastructure. \\nOnly specifically designated individuals are permitted to determine what passes for an \\u201cemergency.\\u201d Such individuals may be specifically designated, or may be designated by \\njob position/description. All assignments for indivi duals or positions will be done by \\nProvost or by a designate of the Provost. \\nWhenever possible and legally permissible, notification must be given to the staff member whose data are subject to subpoena, search warrant, or order of court prior to compliance therewith. Information obtained from an examination warranted by an \\nemergency will not be released to the public, or to the university community or to public \\nofficials, except as such releases are essential to resolution of the emergency, or \\nconstitute ev idence of a crime concealment of which would obstruct justice, and in the \\nlatter case release may only be to appropriate law enforcement officials. Any such findings may be reported to the staff member\\u2019s supervisor, department head, or to Human Resources f or appropriate investigation and action. Any intrusion by an employee \\nof the university into a staff member\\u2019s electronic data must be reported to the staff member as soon as possible, and within five days of the event via electronic mail unless prohibited by order of court, or due to a continuance of an ongoing investigation by the \\nUniversity. Violation of any aspect of this policy is a sanctionable offense. \\nWhen possible, staff members will be informed about the issuance of court orders, or other intrusions into their electronic data. In cases where a staff member believes that electronic data in their account has been inappropriately accessed by another staff member, the incident should be reported to Human Resources. \\nAccess to Student Data \\nElectronic data stored in a student account, whether stored on a computer in the \\nstudent\\u2019s residence or elsewhere under the proprietary control of that student, may not be examined, i.e., the contents of the data read by a person, without the student\\u2019s consent, except in cases of emergency or in response to a valid subpoena, search warrant, order of a court, or by order of the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs. Posting of data by a student on servers available to the public shall be understood to imply consent, and electronic access given to specific parties by the student will likewise imply consent for \\n28 \\n \\n those parties to access permitted data. Emergencies may include, for example, but are \\nnot limited to, the death, incapacity or disappearance of the student, or the sea rch for and \\nexamination of files used for apparently malicious activity in an account which endangers the integrity of shared computers, the network, or other aspects of the university\\u2019s computing infrastructure. \\nOnly specifically designated individuals are permitted to determine what passes for an \\u201cemergency\\u201d. Such individuals may be specifically designated, or may be designated by job position/description. All assignments for individuals or positions will be done by Provost or by a designate of the Provost. \\nWhenever possible and legally permissible, notification must be given to the student whose data are subject to subpoena, search warrant, or order of court prior to compliance therewith. Information obtained from an examination warranted by an \\nemergency will not be released to the public, or to the university community or to public officials, except as such releases are essential to resolution of the emergency, or \\nconstitute evidence of a crime of concealment which would obstruct justice, an d in the \\nlatter case release may only be to appropriate law enforcement officials. Any findings of \\npotential wrongdoing unrelated to the original intent of the search, must be reported to the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs for appropriate investigation and action. Any intrusion by an employee of the University into a student\\u2019s electronic data must be \\nreported to the student as soon as possible, and within five days of the event via electronic mail to the student, if possible, unless prohibited by an order of the court or because of an ongoing investigation conducted by the University. Violation of any aspect of this policy is a sanctionable offense. \\nWhen possible, students will be informed about the issuance of court orders, or other intrusions into t heir electronic data, including the purpose of the search. In cases where a \\nstudent believes that electronic data in their account has been inappropriately accessed by a staff member, the incident should be reported to Office of the Dean of Student Affairs . \\nNote: Removable media such as floppy disks, zip drives, tapes, or CDs in a faculty or staff \\noffice, or in a residence hall are not subject to search by Computing Services, though \\nComputing Services will assist authorized law enforcement agencies or autho rities to read \\ndata after they are obtained, at the agencies\\u2019 or authorities\\u2019 request. \\n29 \\n \\n Prote cting Confidential Information \\nUsers who maintain confidential information, such as records relating to employees or \\nstudents, are responsible for following privacy -related policies, laws, and data use \\nagreements. \\nProtecting Personal Information \\nAs is described throughout this policy, data transmitted across the university network or stored on university systems may be accessed by others as a result of misuse by an individual, as an incidental result of the routine operation of the network and systems, or in response to a court subpoena or university investigation into suspected or alleged misuse. While complete privacy of personal data may not be possible, users who wish to ensure a higher degree of privacy for their data are encouraged to use encryption, PGP security, or other techniques to reduce the risk that others may access their data. \\nMisuse and Inappropriate Behavior \\nThe following activities are expressly prohibited at Carnegie Mellon: \\n\\u2022 Using a computer system without proper authorization granted through the university, college, or department management structure. Some activities such as \\u201cport scanning\\u201d are not expressly prohibited. However, if the target o f such scanning requests that an \\nindividual or system stop performing such actions, the person or system performing \\nthe scans must stop scanning the target machine unless the scans are being carried \\nout by a system administrator who has the authority and r esponsibility over the \\nmachine(s) being scanned or for the network being used. \\n\\u2022 Concealing your identity, or assuming the identity of another (e.g., by sending forged electronic mail). Note that some forms of electronic communication, such as browsing Web pages, passively \\u201cidentify\\u201d users. Keeping your identity private either by not setting an identity in your browser or by using a Web -anonymizer in order to protect \\nyourself from being put onto mailing lists is not a violation of this policy. \\n\\u2022 Sharing your password or account with the specific exception of staff or faculty members allowing their administrative support personnel to access their accounts in order to provide services appropriate to their job functions. Note that some policies for the accessing of specific systems or data (see PCI -DSS Guidelines) explicitly forbid \\nthe sharing of passwords used to access them, and that such restrictions for those specific systems override this policy. \\n30 \\n \\n \\u2022 Using another person\\u2019s computer account, userID, files, or data w ithout appropriate \\npermission, as described in the previous bullet (e.g. using an account found \\u201clogged in\\u201d \\non a cluster machine). \\n\\u2022 Deleting or tampering with another user\\u2019s files or with information stored by another user on any information- bearing medium (disk, tape, memory, etc.). Even if the user\\u2019s \\nfiles are unprotected, with the exception of files obviously intended for public reading, such as Web pages, it is improper for another user to read them unless the owner has given permission (e.g. in an announcement in class or on a computer bulletin board). \\n\\u2022 Attempting to \\u201ccrack\\u201d or guess other users\\u2019 passwords. System administrators or those \\nspecifically designated by the administrator or owner of a system may attempt to crack \\npasswords in order to test and e nhance the security of the system. In cases where an \\nindividual or department \\u201cowns\\u201d machines which use password files controlled by another organization (e.g. Andrew machines or their like), the owner may not attempt to crack passwords without explicit pe rmission by the owners of the password \\ndatabase. \\n\\u2022 Obtaining passwords by other means, such as password capturing and key logging programs. \\n\\u2022 Attempting to circumvent system security (e.g. breaking into a system or using \\nprograms to obtain \\u201croot\\u201d access), with out the explicit permission of the owner of that \\nsystem. \\n\\u2022 Denying appropriate access to resources to other users (e.g. \\u201cping flooding\\u201d another system, sending \\u201cmail bombs,\\u201d or modifying a login file in order to cause a user to not be able to log in). \\n\\u2022 Releas ing programs such as viruses, Trojan horses, worms, etc., that disrupt other \\nusers, damage software or hardware, disrupt network performance, or replicate themselves for malicious purpose. \\n\\u2022 Sending commercial solicitations via electronic mail (i.e. spamming ) to individuals, or to \\nnewsgroups or mailing lists where such advertising is not part of the purpose of the group or list. (It is permissible to send a commercial solicitation to a \\u201cfor sale\\u201d newsgroup, provided that the advertisement conforms to other policies and guidelines at Carnegie Mellon.) \\n\\u2022 Any \\u201cmass mailing\\u201d which is solicitous in nature, unless the mailing is in the conduct of university business. \\n31 \\n \\n \\u2022 Reselling of services based on the university network, such as web hosting, mailing \\nservices or the selling of shell accounts. \\n\\u2022 Running a proxy server which results in inappropriate or unauthorized access to university materials to non- university members. \\n\\u2022 Advertising commercial businesses or ventures on Web pages hosted by Carnegie Mellon, unless prior authorization has been granted. \\n\\u2022 Using mail messages to harass or intimidate another person (such as by repeatedly sending unwanted mail or broadcasting unsolicited mail). \\n\\u2022 Violations of any local, state or federal laws, such as the distribution of copyright -\\nprotected materials (e.g. the distribution of commercial software, music or films in \\nelectronic format without appropriate permissions by the owner, even if the user distributing the materials notifies others of their copyright status). \\n\\u2022 Tampering with, willful destruction of or theft of any computer equipment, whether it belongs to the university or to an individual. Tampering includes any deliberate effort \\nto degrade or halt a system, to tie up a system or to compromise the system/network \\nperformance. Willful destruction includes any deliberate disabling or damaging of computer systems, peripheral equipment such as scanners or printers, or other facilities or equipment including the network, and any deliberate destruction or impairment of software or other users\\u2019 files or data. \\n\\u2022 The unauthorized removal of university or another's computing equipment, which constitutes theft. \\nThis list should not be considered to be complete or exhaustive. It should, however, serve as a set of examples of obviously inappropriat e behaviors. If you are in doubt about the \\nappropriateness of something that you want to do, contact the Computing Services Help Center at 412 -268- HELP, or send mail to it -help@andrew.cmu.edu\\n and ask first. \\nEnforcement \\nInappropriate behavior in the use of computers is punishable under the general university policies and regulations regarding faculty, students and staff. The offenses mentioned in this policy range from relatively minor to extremely serious, though even a minor offense may be treated severely if it is repeated or malicious. Certain offenses may also be subject to prosecution under federal, state or local laws. \\nAppropriate disciplinary action depends not o nly on the nature of the offense, but also on \\nthe intent and previous history of the offender. The range of possible penalties includes \\n32 \\n \\n reprimands, loss of computing privileges, course failures for students, disciplinary \\nprobation, suspension or dismissal from the university and/or criminal prosecution. \\nOffenses that are minor or appear to be accidental in nature are often handled in a very informal manner such as through electronic mail. More serious offenses involve formal procedures pursued through the D ivision of Student Affairs for students, Human \\nResources and/or the hiring university department or administrative unit for staff, or the Faculty Review Committee for faculty. \\nRestrictions of Privileges During Investigations \\nDuring the course of an investi gation of alleged inappropriate or unauthorized use, it may \\nbe necessary to temporarily suspend a user\\u2019s network or computing privileges, but only after determining there is at least a prima facie case against the individual, as well as a risk to the unive rsity or its computing resources if privileges are not revoked. In these \\ncases, it is important to recognize that the restriction of network or computing privileges is intended to protect the system rather than to punish the individual. For example, if a computer account has been used to launch an attack on another system, that account will \\nbe rendered inactive until the investigation is complete. This is a necessary action taken to prevent further misuse and does not presume that the account holder initiated the misuse. Unsubstantiated reports of abuse will not result in the suspension of accounts or network access unless sufficient evidence is provided to show that inappropriate activity occurred. For example, if someone reports that their computer was \\u201cat tacked\\u201d by a \\nCarnegie Mellon system, the burden will be upon the complainant to provide sufficient data logs or other evidence to show that the incident did, indeed at least appear to be an attack . \\nAdverse Impact on Shared Systems \\nThe university reserves the right to discontinue communication with external systems that are known to harbor spammers, account crackers, or phishing sites, despite the fact that this may restrict certain acceptable communications. When deemed necessary, this action \\nwill be taken to protect the security and safety of our systems. Similarly, there may be cases where a particular service or activity on a given university system will, by the very nature of its legitimate operation, tend to generate attacks f rom other Internet sites. If \\nthese attacks are frequent and severe enough to cause service interruptions for larger parts of the campus community, it may be necessary to temporarily or permanently \\nremove these systems from the campus network. In cases wher e such an action is \\ndeemed necessary, network administrators will work with the maintainers of the system \\nto identify alternative methods of network access. In cases where the university restricts \\n33 \\n \\n access to external sites or removes network access for inte rnal sites, the purpose of the \\naction is to maintain the security and reliability of the computer systems and networks \\nrather than to punish an individual or a site, or to restrict the free expression of ideas . \\nConduct of Classes (Undergraduate Students) \\nStudents are expected to attend all scheduled classes unless the instructor explicitly informs \\nthe class that other ways of doing the work are acceptable. The action to be taken in regard to tardiness, absence from class or making up late work is the respon sibility of the individual \\ninstructor; the instructor should consult with the department head and the student's dean if \\nmajor action, such as dropping the student from the course , is being considered. \\nAll classes will be held at their scheduled hour on days immediately before and after all \\nholidays and recesses. Both faculty and stude nts are expected to be present. \\nMembers of athletic teams and other student organizations are permitted to be absent from classes to participate in authorized contests and presentations, either at home or out of town, provided th e following conditions are met: \\n\\u2022 All work missed must be made up to the satisfaction of the instructor(s) concerned; \\n\\u2022 No trip shall involve an absence of more than two days, excluding days when classes are \\nnot scheduled; \\n\\u2022 The total number of days of absence shall not exceed six per sport or per organization annually; \\n\\u2022 Instructor(s) may request confirmation from the relevant coach, department or student \\naffairs staff member. \\nTechnology affords many students access to portable devices including cell phones, PDAs, \\nand laptops. It is expected that students will respect the wishes of faculty with regard to the \\nuse of electronic devices within the academic environment. \\nStudents who, because of religious beliefs, cannot attend class may arrange as individuals to be absent, provided the work missed is made up in a manner satisfactory to the instructor(s) of the class(es) missed. \\nNo student shall leave a scheduled exercise because of the absence of the instructor unt il a \\nreasonable time has passed. By tradition and as a matter of courtesy a student should wait 10 minutes before leaving. \\n34 \\n \\n \\nCross-College and University Registration PCHE (Pittsburgh Council on \\nHigher Education) Guidelines Policy \\nStatement \\nCross -registration provides opportunities for enriched educational programs by \\npermitting full -time paying undergraduate and graduate students to cross -register for one \\ncourse at a Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) Institution. Full- time Carnegie \\nMellon degree students are eligible. The PCHE course may not count towards full- time \\nstatus unless the student is enrolled in an inter -university program. There is no additional \\ntuition charge, except for special course or laboratory fees. Carnegie Mellon students do \\nnot acquire status at the host institution, but are given library and bookstore privileges. Credit and grades are transferred directly to the home institution. Cross -registration is not \\napplicable during the Summer Session(s) or during intersessions . \\nThere a re nine approved PCHE Institutions in the Pittsburgh area: \\nCarlow University (412- 578- 6084), Chatham College (412- 365- 1121), CCAC\\n (412- 237- 2555), \\nDuquesne University (412- 396- 6230), LaRoche College (412- 367-9300), Pittsburgh \\nTheological Seminary (412- 362- 5610), Point Park University (412- 392- 3861), Robert M orris \\nCollege (412- 262- 8256), University of Pittsburgh (412- 624- 1544) \\n1. Each college or university accepts registration from the other institutions; however, \\nfirst priority is given to students of the host institution, and not all departments or \\nschools in all institutions are able to participate in this program . \\n2. In each case of a student cross -registration, the approval of the dean or a designated \\nindividual from the home college or university must be obtained prior to registration . \\n3. In addition, the student's advisor or dean is responsible for assuring the student's \\neligibility for the course in which he/she intends to enroll . \\n4. Full credit and grades for cross -registered courses will be transferred to the \\nappropriate institution; the academic regulations of the host university will prevail. \\n5. The academic honesty code and other rules of conduct of the institution providing \\ninstruction apply with respect to its courses and behavior on its campus. That \\ninstitution also determines whether its rules have or have not bee n violated. The \\nstudent's own institution will impose such penalties as it considers proper when \\nviolations are reported to it. \\n35 \\n \\n 6. Cross -registrants do not thereby acquire the status of students in the institutions in \\nwhich they are receiving instruction (e.g ., for purposes of participation in student \\nactivities, insurance programs, etc.). They do receive library privileges at the host \\ninstitution and may purchase course texts at the host bookstore . \\n7. Each qualified student normally may enroll in no more than one course off campus in any one term or semester under this program. Students wishing to cross -register for \\nmore than one course in a term must have approval from the appropriate academic \\noffices at both schools . \\n8. No additional tuition charge is made to students who are participating in this program; however, the student who cross -registers is responsible for paying any \\ncourse or laboratory fees to the host . \\n9. Cross -registration does not apply to summer sessions at any of the institutions . \\n10. Adding or dropping a course after the home institution's deadline date requires \\npermission from the home institution; adding or dropping a course after the host institution's deadline date requires permission from the host institution . \\n11. Students enrolled in approved joint co -op programs between two PCHE institutions \\nare exempt from the requirement of being full- time at either school in order to cross \\nregister. Students are bound by the requirements of that program . \\n12. Carnegie Mellon students may not cross -register for required cou rses that are \\nnormally available at Carnegie Mellon. Exceptions may be made if courses are \\nunavailable or legitimate schedule conflicts seriously hinder completion of degree \\nrequirements within the prescribed timeframe . \\n13. \\\"PCHE Cross -Registration Request\\\" forms are available from The HUB . \\nDoctoral Stud ent Status Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nThe university has a policy that covers: time limits on doctoral student status, a definition \\nof All But Dissertation status, a definition of In Residence and In Absentia status for doctoral \\nstudents and the tuition and fees charged for students In Residen ce and students In \\nAbsentia . \\n36 \\n \\n These rules apply to all doctoral students. Students who began their doctoral studies prior \\nto the date of this policy\\u2019s revision may follow time -to-degree requirements from the \\nprevious policy, but all other rules set forth in this policy will apply immediately to all \\ndoctoral students. \\nTime to Degree \\nStudents will complete all requirements for the Ph.D. degree within a maximum of ten years from original matriculation as a doctoral student, or less if required by a more restrictive department or college policy. Once this time -to-degree limit has lapsed, the \\nperson may resume work towards a doctoral degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered doctoral degree program under criteria determined by that program. \\nUnder extrao rdinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, \\nfamily or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer the laps e of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of \\nthat interruption. Students, who are pursuing the Ph.D. degree as part -time students for \\nall semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit. \\nAll But Dissertation Status \\nAll But Dissertation, ABD, status is intended for students whose only remaining requirements are the completion and defense of their dissertation. Once a student m eets \\nthe departmental criteria \\n[1], All But Dissertation status must be approved by the \\ndepartment by submitting the appropriate form to CMURegistrar@andrew.cmu.edu . \\nIn Residence Versus In Absentia \\nOnce students achieve All But Dissertation status, they must choose whether to complete their dissertation In Residence or In Absentia . A doctoral student In Residence maintains \\nstudent status and all consequent student privileges and continues to be actively engaged with the university. A doctoral student In Absentia status is one who has left the university \\nwith the intent of completing their dissertation but is not actively engaged with the university and does not require university resources. When a student decides whether to pursue All But Dissertation In Residence or In Absentia, they must complete a Doctoral \\nStudent Status Agreement form, which is available through their academic department or \\non the HUB\\n website. Once the agreement has been approved by the student\\u2019s \\n \\n1 General examples of having met All But Dissertation requirements may include completing all courses and passing qualifying \\nexams; completing all courses and acceptance of dissertation proposal; etc. as defined by program, department or school. \\n37 \\n \\n department, the student may change their status between In Residence and In Absentia \\nmultiple times with approval. A student In Residence or In Absentia must meet the specific \\ncriteria noted later in this policy . \\nStudents In Absentia will not be verified by the university as an enrolled \\\"student\\\" for \\nimmigration or loan purposes. All But Dissertation students in J1 or F1 immigration status \\nmust continue to follow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations [2]. \\nAll But Disserta tion Students In Residence \\nAll But Dissertation students In Residence receiving any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), tied to activities that are integral to their doctoral program that is paid by or administered by the university must be \\nenrolled for at least thirty -six units to maintain full time student status and all subsequent \\nstudent privileges. Exceptions to the thirty -six unit enrollment requirement may be \\ngranted by the Provost \\n[3]. \\nAll But Dissertation students In Residence who are not receiving any financial support \\n(such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), from the university tied to activities that are integral to their doctoral program should c onsult their \\ncollege policy to determine the number of units for which they must be registered in order to maintain full -time student status and all subsequent privileges . \\nAll But Dissertation students In Residence who are pursuing their doctoral degree on a part time basis and are not receiving any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), from the university tied to activities that are integral to their doctor al program should consult their college policy to determine the \\nnumber of units they must be registered for in order to maintain part time student status and all subsequent privileges. Note that doctoral students must be a full time graduate student for at least one academic year or more if required by the student\\u2019s home college . \\nAll But Dissertation students who are employed by the university in a capacity independent of their educational program and are pursuing a doctoral degree part time, may register f or the number of units required by their department in order to remain in \\npart time status so long as they are not receiving any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), tied to activities that are in tegral \\n \\n2 The intent of the DHS regulations is that the student continues to pursue completion of the degree on a full- time basis under \\nthe jurisdiction of the university that will award the degree. International students who enter All But Dissertation status m ust \\nremain In Residence and be registered full -time as defined in this policy to preserve F1 or J1 immigration status while they \\ncomplete their degree. Questions about All But Dissertation status and immigration requirements should be addressed to the \\nOffice of International Education. \\n3 If granted exception results in the student\\u2019s enrollment being reduced to less than half time, tax consequences may apply. \\n38 \\n \\n to their doctoral program by their college, school or department. Questions about \\neligibility for tuition benefits should be referred to the Benefits Department. \\nFinal Semester Tuition for All But Dissertation Students In Residence \\nStudents who are supported by the university must be registered for thirty -six units for \\nthe entirety of their final semester and will be assessed their college\\u2019s full- time tuition . \\nFULL -TIME STUDENTS \\nIf a student completes all Ph.D. degree re quirements and is certified by : \\n\\u2022 September 30th (in the fall), or February 28th (in the spring), tuition will be adjusted \\nto $0; however, they will remain enrolled for thirty -six units for the semester. \\n\\u2022 October 31st (in the fall), or March 31st (in the spring), tuition will be adjusted to 50% \\nof the full -time tuition; however, they will remain enrolled for thirty -six units for the \\nsemester. \\n\\u2022 After October 31st (in the fall), or after March 31st (in the spring), but BEFORE the \\nfirst day of the next semester, tuition will not be adjusted an d they will remain \\nenrolled for thirty -six units for the semester. \\n\\u2022 Fees will not be adjusted after the semester course add deadline . \\n\\u2022 Tuition will not be assessed in the summer, except for students who return from All \\nBut Dissertation In Absentia status and who are registered for thirty -six units. For \\nthose students who are certified by June 15th tuition will be adjusted to $0; for those \\nwho are certified by July 15th tuition will be adjusted to 50% of the full -time tuition. \\nFor those who are certified after July 15th but BEFORE the first day of the next \\nsemester, tuition will not be adjusted, and they will remain enrolled for thirty -six \\nunits for the semester . \\nPART -TIME STUDENTS \\nStudents registered for fewer than thirty -six units are not eligible for a tuition \\nadjustment, regardless of their certification date. Fees will not be adjusted. \\nAll But Dissertation Students In Absentia \\nAn All But Dissertation doctoral student may, upon departmental approval, be regarded \\nas In Absentia when, and so long as, the following three conditions apply : \\n\\u2022 The student has been enrolled as a full- time graduate student at Carnegie Mellon \\nUniversity for at least one academic year or more if required by the student's home \\n39 \\n \\n college. Part -time graduate enrollment may, at the department's discretion, be \\ncounted pro -rata toward this requirement. \\n\\u2022 The student does not receive any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or \\nhealth insurance) tied to activities that are integral to their doctoral program that is paid by or administered by the university . \\n\\u2022 The student does not require substantial use of university resources. Departmental approval of this condition shall be subject to guidelines established by the school or college . \\nAccording to university guidelines, students In Abs entia may\\n [4]: \\n\\u2022 Use University Libraries. \\n\\u2022 Use the university stores. \\n\\u2022 Use computing facilities only for department communications and for dissertation text \\npreparation. \\n\\u2022 Enter university buildings for faculty/student consultations. \\n\\u2022 Be eligible for student health insurance as determi ned on a case by case basis [5]. \\n\\u2022 Use the Career and Professional Development Center. \\n\\u2022 Become university employees. \\nMay not: \\n\\u2022 Be employed with a graduate student stipend [6]. \\n\\u2022 Maintain legal F1 or J1 student status. \\n\\u2022 Use University Health Services [5]. \\n\\u2022 Buy parking permits [7]. \\n\\u2022 Use athletic facilities [7]. \\n \\n4 An All But Dissertation student In Absentia may be hired as an university employee without switching to active student status \\nso long as the hiring department certifies that the student is not hired at Carnegie Mellon for work directly related to his/ her \\ndissertation and that the student does not inappropriately make substantial use of resources for work towards the doctorate a s \\nnoted above. As an employee, an individual would be eligible for benefits that apply to his/her status as an employee, not a s a \\ngraduate student . \\n5 University Health Services is not available to students in In Absentia status, except in an emergency, or on a case by case basis. \\nAll inquiries may be directed to the Manager of Business Operations, University Health Services. \\n6 Graduate students are not considered employees of the university as their primary affiliation with the university is as a stu dent. \\n7 An individual whose primary relationship with the university is as an employee and who as Ph.D. student moves to the status o f \\nABD In Absentia will be eligible for benefits that apply to his/her status as an employee. \\n40 \\n \\n \\u2022 Reside in university housing. \\nEmployment of All But Dissertation Students In Absentia \\nAs noted above, All But Dissertation students In Absentia are extended only minimum \\naccess to university resources. The student does not receive any financial support (such as \\ntuition, stipend, fees, or health insurance, whether full or partial), tied to a ctivities that are \\nintegral to their doctoral program paid by or administered by the university. An All But \\nDissertation student In Absentia cannot be hired for work by Carnegie Mellon University \\ndirectly related to completing their dissertation and/or mak e substantial use of resources \\nfor work toward the doctorate as noted above [4]. In order to be in compliance with these \\npolicies, the university's employment policies and the Internal Revenue Service, an All But \\nDissertation student In Absentia may only be hired for university employment through the appropriate employment process. Questions should be referred to Human Resources. \\nTuition and Fee Effects of In Absentia Student Status Including the Final Semester \\nWhile an All But Dissertation student is In Ab sentia , no tuition will be assessed. The student \\nwill, however, be responsible for all applicable fees. \\nAn All But Dissertation student who is In Absentia , who returns to defend their dissertation \\nhas several options: \\n1. A student who receives support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, \\nwhether full or partial) paid for or administered by the university, must follow the \\npolicy for Final Semester Tuition for All But Dissertation Students In Residence (see \\nabove) and is eligible for the tuition to be pro -rated as identified in the schedule . \\n2. A student who is not receiving any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), paid for or administered by the university \\nand is returning to the universit y must change from In Absentia to In Residence and \\nshall be assessed for a minimum of five units of graduate study based on their \\ncurrent school/college\\u2019s tuition before the degree is certified. The tuition rate will not \\nbe adjusted based on certification date . \\na. A student returns to the university solely for the purpose of the defense and is In Residence for 10 or fewer days would pay the technology fee in addition to the \\ntuition . \\nb. A student returns to the university solely for the purpose of the defense and is In \\nResidence for more than 10 days would pay the technology, transportation, and \\nstudent activities fee in addition to the tuition . \\n41 \\n \\n 3. A student who is In Absentia may petition their program to complete and defend their \\ndissertation without a return to campus. Such a student will be not be charged \\ntuition but would be charged a Dissertation Completion Fee and technology fee . \\nEvaluation and Certification of English Fluency for Instructors Policy \\nSummary of How the Carnegie Mellon Policy Satisfies the Penn sylvania English \\nFluency in Higher Education Act \\n\\u2022 The Pennsylvania English Fluency in Higher Education Act requires the University to file annually with the Pennsylvania Department of Education a certification stating that its \\ninstructional personnel are fluent in the English language. All instructional personnel, both native and nonnative speakers of English who teach undergraduate students, \\nmust be included in CMU's annual certification process . \\n\\u2022 Faculty members who are native speakers of En glish and who teach undergraduates \\nwill be certified by their departments on the basis of conversations with the dean, \\ndepartment head or specified designee. Departments cannot assume that someone is a native speaker without talking with him or her . \\n\\u2022 The fluency of non- native English speaking faculty members will be evaluated through \\ntwo interviews: one with the dean, department head or specified designee, and the \\nsecond with a senior faculty member. All interviewers must be native speakers of \\nEnglish . \\n\\u2022 TA En glish fluency \\u2014 both graduate and undergraduate \\u2014 is managed through the \\nInternational Teaching Assistant testing process administered by CMU's \\nIntercultural \\nCommunication Center . \\n(Note: CMU policy requires the International Teaching Assistant Test for TAs of both \\ngraduate as well as undergraduate classes.) \\n\\u2022 Consistent with Pennsylvania law, CMU allows for the following exemptions from \\ncertification: 1) visiting faculty, 2) faculty who will teach courses taught predominantly in a foreign language, 3) faculty who do not teach undergraduate students, and 4) \\nfaculty who work one -on-one with students . \\n(Note: CMU requires TAs to take the ITA for any job that requires student int eraction.) \\n42 \\n \\n \\nExaminations\\n for Undergraduate Courses Policy \\nPreamble \\nThe Faculty Senate adopted the following policies on the administration of examinations \\nfor the undergraduate courses (defined as courses that are numbered 6xx or below). \\nThese policies represent an understanding between faculty and student concerning an important but often stressful period, especially at th e conclusion of each academic \\nsemester and at mid- semester. There should be no expectation that the following points \\nwill cover every conceivable situation. The student should anticipate the demands of the exam schedule, plan accordingly and early, and be prepared. The faculty should recognize that the student is encumbered with many tightly orchestrated and intensive obligations during this period over which he or she has no control: expectations should be reasonably consistent with the number of course units and, of course, should be made known to the student well in advance of the final examination period, preferably as part of the course syllabus . \\nIn order to help students plan their time and study optimally for examinations, this document lays out in some detail the policies regarding final and in -term examinations. \\nInstructors are requested to provide notification of the major in -term examinations in the \\ncourse syllabus. The final examination date is posted early in the semester. It is the responsibilit y of the student to give his or her instructor sufficient notice and to work with \\nthe instructor to re -schedule examinations if this is needed . \\nDefinitions \\n\\u2022 Final examination period. The university's official final examination period begins on \\nthe Monday immediately following the last day of classes and continues through the \\nlast day of scheduled final examinations, with the exception of reading day(s). \\n\\u2022 Scheduled final examinations. Scheduled final examinations are those scheduled by \\nthe University Registrar's Office . \\n\\u2022 Self-scheduled examinations. An instructor may choose not to fix a schedule for the \\nfinal examination, but instead allow each student to choose the examination time; such exams are called self -scheduled examinations . \\n\\u2022 Final examinations. Final examinations can either be comprehensive, covering all \\ncourse materials, or non- comprehensive, covering only a part of the course . \\n\\u2022 In-term examinations. Major examinations during the semester are referred to here as \\nin-term examinations . \\n43 \\n \\n Policies \\nI. In-term Examinations \\n1. All in -term examinations should be given during the regularly scheduled class time. \\nHowever, if the exam requires additional time to complete, then examinations may \\nbe administered outside of regularly scheduled class time. \\n2. No examina tions given outside of class time (excluding make ups and self -scheduled \\nexaminations) shall be administered on a Friday after 4:30 pm, or at any time Saturday or Sunday. \\n3. The instructor administering an exam (or another required class event) that falls outside class time must make any and all reasonable accommodations to provide an \\nalternative time to students who have conflicts with the proposed time period, \\nincluding those conflicts due to activities, meetings, other classes, etc. (provided that \\nthe instr uctor is notified of such conflict in a timely manner) . \\n4. No student shall be required to take more than two full- period in -class or out -of-class \\nexaminations on the same day. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor in a timely manne r of his/her circumstance so that appropriate \\naccommodations can be made . \\nII. Final Examinations \\n1. All scheduled final examinations are held at the end of the semester during the university's official final examination period. Comprehensive final examination s are \\nnot required for each course, but are given at the option of the department or instructor. The reading day and weekend preceding the examination days shall never be used for examination purposes of any kind, unless a student opts to take a self -\\nsched uled examination during this time. Non -comprehensive final examinations or \\nfinal projects (but not both) are allowed during this final examination period only in \\ncourses that do not give a final comprehensive examination. \\n2. Instructors are expected to return all work assigned no later than the last regular day \\nof classes in courses for which there is a final examination. In cases when this is not \\npossible, an answer key, solution sets or equivalent feedback should be provided \\nunless the final examination will not cover material in work that has not been \\nreturned . \\n44 \\n \\n 3. No other coursework, including laboratory or studio work, will be due during the final \\nexamination period unless it is assigned in advance and in lieu of the course's final \\nexamination. Regardless of whether there is a final examination in the course, no \\nclasses other than review sessions shall be held during the final examination period. \\nReview sessions should be scheduled for optimal attendance, and a serious effort \\nshould be made to accommodate stud ents who cannot attend. In appreciation of the \\ntime required to prepare for final examinations, no other examinations, portfolio \\nreviews, critiques or juries shall be scheduled for the last class day of a course with a \\nfinal examination. \\n4. Instructors shall never exert or submit to pressures to move an examination so that people can leave earlier nor pressure students to take an examination on a reading day or weekend preceding examinations . \\n5. No student is required to take more than two scheduled examinations that start within a 25 -hour period. A student who has more than two examinations scheduled \\nwithin a 25 -hour period or has two examinations scheduled at the same time should \\nfirst contact the instructors of the courses for assistance in resolving conflicts. If the \\nproblem cannot be resolved by that means, the student should contact the associate \\ndean of his or her home college . \\n6. Take -home final examinations shall be given for any 24 -hour period of the student's \\nchoosing during the final examination period . \\n7. Students are expected to present themselves at the place assigned at the start of the \\nexamination; late arrival will reduce the total time a student has to complete the examination, unless instructor's course policy indicates otherwise. Instructors \\nreserve t he right to require attendance within a specific time period. Students who \\nmiss an examination with a reasonable excuse and wish to petition for a make -up \\nfinal examination should check with the instructor. Instructors are encouraged to include late arriva l policy and make -up exam policy in the course syllabus . \\n8. Any student shall be permitted to review his or her corrected, graded final examination in the presence of an instructor or a teaching assistant. Any controversy arising from this review shall be dea lt with in accordance with the university \\nprocedure for the appeal of grades and academic actions. A final examination that is not returned to a student will be kept available for a year for review. In the event that \\nthe instructor or teaching assistant is not available for the review, the responsibility \\n45 \\n \\n shall rest with the department head of the instructor offering the course or his or her \\ndesignee. Since instructors are expected to return all work assigned before the final \\nexaminations, they are not respo nsible for retaining unclaimed coursework . \\n9. Concerns related to final examination, complaints about violations of the final examination policy or alterations of the final examination schedule should be \\ndirected to the department head of the instructor offering the course or to the \\nassociate dean of the student's home college . \\nFair Use Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nMembers of the university community often find it necessary to make scholarly use of \\nmaterials copyrighted by third- parties. The Copyri ght Act contains many exceptions and \\nlimitations that permit the use of a work without the permission of the copyright owner, most notably fair use . \\n1. It is the policy of Carnegie Mellon University that all members of the University \\ncommunity must comply wit h U.S. Copyright Law, in particular the Copyright Act of \\n1976, 17 U.S.C \\u00a7 1, et seq . \\n2. Copyrighted works may be used freely by the copyright owner. Works in the public \\ndomain (generally, material published before 1923) may be used freely by everyone . \\n3. Facult y, students, and staff members of Carnegie Mellon University may use \\ncopyrighted materials of other parties provided such activities are allowed by license \\nor by a specific exception in copyright law including but not limited to : \\n\\u2022 17 U.S.C. \\u00a7 108 - library uses; \\n\\u2022 17 U.S.C. \\u00a7 109(a) - the first sale doctrine; \\n\\u2022 17 U.S.C. \\u00a7 109(a) - the right to display copies; \\n\\u2022 17 U.S.C. \\u00a7 110(1) - performance and display in classrooms; \\n\\u2022 17 U.S.C. \\u00a7 110(2) - distance education; and \\n\\u2022 17 U.S.C. \\u00a7 121 - reproduction and distribution o f copies in specialized formats for \\nthe print disabled. \\n46 \\n \\n 4. When a proposed use is not permitted by license and does not fall within one of the \\nspecific exceptions, it may still be permitted under the fair use doctrine, codified at \\n17 U.S.C. \\u00a7 107. Appendix A to this policy contains guidance to assist university \\ncommunity members in determining whether a use qualifies as a fair use . \\n5. When a proposed use of copyright material does not fall within the fair use doctrine \\nand is not otherwise permitted by license or exception, written permission from the \\ncopyright owner is required to engage in use . \\nAppendix A: Guidance on Fair Use Standards \\nBackground \\nThe ability to reuse pre -existing copyrighted materials is central to the mission of the \\nUniversity in the 21st Century. A faculty member might wish to include a quotation in a \\nbook or distribute an article to her students through a course website. A student might \\nwant to create a multimedia project incorporating images, film clips, and music samples \\nfor a class assignment. A librarian may seek to digitally preserve archival material. The \\nCopyright Act contains many exceptions and limitations that permit the use of a work without the permission of the copyright owner, most notably fair use. Although these except ions have always been important to the academic enterprise, the digital revolution \\nenables a wide range of new uses that significantly enhance the educational and scholarly process, thereby increasing the reliance on these exceptions generally, and fair us e in \\nparticular . \\nAccording to the Supreme Court, the objectives of the fair use doctrine are to preserve free speech and to promote creativity. Codified in the Copyright Act of 1976 at 17 U.S.C. \\u00a7 107, the preamble to the fair use doctrine lists six favore d purposes: criticism, comment, \\nteaching, scholarship, and research. For this reason, the Supreme Court has recognized that \\\"the fair use defense affords considerable latitude for scholarship and comment.\\\" \\nAfter the preamble, Section 107 sets forth four no n-exclusive factors courts must consider \\nin determining whether a use is fair. Courts have broadened their interpretation of the \\nfour factors significantly over time. Recent interpretations have favored educational uses involving new technologies . \\nWhen conducting a fair use analysis, members of the University community should consider (1) the fair use factors and (2) applicable codes of best practices. The following \\n47 \\n \\n guidance is designed to assist members of the University community in conducting a \\nproper f air use analysis. [8] \\n1. The Fair Use Factors \\nMembers of the University community are required by Section 107 to consider and balance the following factors to determine if a use qualifies as a fair use. The factors should not be balanced mechanically, but weighed together \\\"in light of the purposes of copyright.\\\" The ultimate test of fair use \\\"is whether copyright's goal of promoting the \\nProgress of Science and useful Arts would be better served by allowing the use than by \\npreventing it.\\\" \\nA. The purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial \\nnature or is for nonprofit educational purposes . \\n\\u2022 Courts have favored nonprofit education uses, including making multiple copies for \\nclassroom use, and \\\"transformative\\\" use s where the new use does not supersede the \\noriginally intended use . \\n\\u2022 The repurposing or re -contextualization of a work can be transformative, even if the \\nwork itself is not modified. \\n\\u2022 Digitization of works to provide access to the print disabled, to enable indexing, and to enable \\\"non- consumptive research\\\" (e.g. text mining) has been considered \\ntransformative . \\nB. Nature of the copyrighted work. \\n\\u2022 Courts have favored uses of factual works, as opposed to fiction, and uses of \\npublished works as opposed to unpublis hed works. \\n\\u2022 If a use is transformative, the nature of the work is less important. \\nC. Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a \\nwhole. \\n\\u2022 Minimal copying does not trigger infringement liability and thus does not require fair \\nuse analysis. \\n\\u2022 The extent of permissible copying under fair use varies with the purpose and \\ncharacter of the use. \\n \\n8 This guidance contains citations to some more recent court decisions. For the sake of brevity not all legal principles in this \\nguidance contain citations. Please contact the Office of the General Counsel if you have any questions regarding this guidan ce. \\n48 \\n \\n \\u2022 Copying an entire work may be permissible if necessary to achieve a legitimate \\npurpose. For example, the copying of entire works d id not weight against fair use \\nwhen necessary for the purpose of providing access to the print disabled or providing a search index to complete works . \\n\\u2022 Copying of a quantitatively small portion of a work can weigh against fair use if the portion used is \\\"th e heart\\\" of the work . \\n\\u2022 The inclusion of one chapter of a book in electronic course reserves did not weigh \\nagainst fair use even when the publisher made available licenses for digital excerpts . \\nD. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. \\n\\u2022 Although in the past this factor was considered to be the most important in the fair use analysis, this no longer is true. \\n\\u2022 Courts examine whether the secondary use usurps the market for the original work. \\n\\u2022 With respect to impact on potential licensing revenue, courts look at \\\"traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets.\\\" \\n\\u2022 Markets for transformative uses are not traditional markets; hence, a transformative use does not impair the market for purposes of this factor. \\n\\u2022 Even when a court concluded a use was non- transformative, it considered the \\nadverse impact on a licensing market only if the license was easily accessible, reasonably priced, and available for the portion and format the user sought to use. \\nE. Good Faith of User \\n\\u2022 Some courts have identified a fifth, non -statutory factor: whether the user acted in \\ngood faith. \\n\\u2022 This factor should typically weigh in favor of nonprofit educational uses. \\n\\u2022 Documentation of the user's fair use analysis, such as a fair use checklist or a statement of pedagogical need, demonstrates the user's good faith. \\nAlthough copyright law generally does not require a user to attribute the source of \\nmaterial, such attribution demonstrates the user's good faith. (Attribution often also is required as a matter of academic ethics as well as the terms of a Creative Commons license. ) \\nIn addition, courts have treated as fair use: \\n49 \\n \\n \\u2022 Copying incidental to the streaming of films assigned for courses [9]; \\n\\u2022 Inclusion of chapters of monographs (but not textbooks) in electronic course reserves [10]; \\nand \\n\\u2022 Mass digitization of books for the purpose of preservation, creating a search index, and \\nproviding access to the print disabled. [11] \\nWhen considering similar uses, members of the University community should treat these \\ndecisions as important guideposts. \\n2. Best Practices \\nSeveral educational communities have developed codes of best practices in fair use.[12] \\nThese codes each represent a community's consensus about acceptable practices for the fair use of copyrighted materials. Legal scholarship has demonstrated that courts give weight to what a relevant community considers to be acceptable practice. When exercising the fair use doctrine, members of the University community should consult and follow the app ropriate code of best practices. \\nIn particular, the Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Academic and Research Libraries (see \\nlink below) articulates a set of principles for how fair use applies to certain common \\npractices in the university setting. The Code sets forth limitations that should be observed to assure that the case for fair use is strong, and enhancements that could further \\nstrengthen that case. These principles include that it is fair use to: \\n\\u2022 Make appropriately tailored course -related content available to enrolled students via \\ndigital networks; \\n\\u2022 Make digital copies for purposes of preservation, and to make these copies available \\nas surrogates for fragile and inaccessible materials; \\n\\u2022 Create digital versions of a library's special collections and to make these versions \\nelectronically accessible in appropriate contexts; \\n \\n9 Association for Info. Media and Equip. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. , 2011 WL 7447148 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2011). \\n10 Cambridge Univ. Press v. Becker, 769 F.3d 1262 (11th Cir. 2014). \\n11 Authors Guild Inc., v. Hathi Trust, 755 F.3d 87 (2nd Cir. 2014). \\n12 See Association of Research Libraries, Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Academic and Research Libraries (available at \\nhttp://www.arl.org/focus -areas/copyright -ip/fair -use/code -of-best -practices#.W7JRcWhKhPY); see also American University \\nCenter for S ocial Media, Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Open Course Ware; Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Media Literacy \\nEducation; Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Scholarly Research in Communication; and Society for Cinema and Media Studies' \\nStatement of Best Practices in Fair Use in Teaching for Film and Media Educators (available at http://www.cmsimpact.org ). \\n50 \\n \\n \\u2022 Reproduce materials in accessible formats for disabled students when fully accessible \\ncopies are not readily available for commercial sources; \\n\\u2022 Receive material for an institutional repository, and to make deposited works publicly available; \\n\\u2022 Develop digital databases to enable non -consumptive analysis for scholarly and \\nreference purposes, including search; and \\n\\u2022 Create collections of websites and other material from the Internet and to make them \\navailable for scholarly use. \\nThe enhancements often involve the use of technological measures to restrict access to \\nthe appropriate set of users, and to prevent unnecessarily broad dissemination. Like the judicial determinations of fair use, this Code of Best Practices should inform the fair use \\ncalculus performed by members of the University community.\\n[13] \\nAlthough the judicial decisions and the Codes of Best Practices are instructive, members of \\nthe University must consider the application o f the fair use doctrine to the unique facts of \\nthe proposed used. \\nFinal Examinations for Graduate Courses \\nThere is no university policy on the administration of final examinations for the graduate courses. Students should consult their department or college handbooks for applicable policies. Concerns related to final examinations for graduate courses may be directed to the course instructor, the department head of the instructor offering the course, or to the graduate associate dean (or equivalent) of the student\\u2019s home college. \\nFor information pertaining to final examinations for undergraduate students, please review the Examinations for Undergraduate Students Policy\\n. \\nFinancial Aid Policy \\nStatement \\nUniversit y Academic Scholarship Renewals \\nCarnegie Mellon University awards academic scholarships as part of the freshman \\nfinancial aid process. Each of these scholarships is renewable for four academic years of \\n \\n13 As noted above, other fair use Codes of Best Practices may b e relevant as well. \\n51 \\n \\n study (five f or architecture) based upon the maintenance of a specific cumulative quality \\npoint average. The academic scholarship renewal criteria are included in the scholarship \\nnotification letter which is mailed to the student prior to the May 1 matriculation deadli ne. \\nEach scholarship recipient's cumulative quality point average is reviewed at the end of each academic year. If the student achieves the scholarship renewal criteria, then the scholarship is automatically renewed for the next academic year . \\nIf the student does not meet the cumulative quality point average requirement for renewal, then s/he is given the opportunity to appeal. A merit scholarship appeal form and instructions are automatically sent to the student at the end of each academic year . \\nThe s tudent's completed appeal form is reviewed by members of the Enrollment Services \\nstaff. Input from the Associate Dean of the student's college is also considered. The student is notified, in writing, of the decision. The decision may be to renew the schola rship for the entire academic year, renew the scholarship for one academic term, or \\nto reject the appeal. If the appeal is rejected, a written explanation is provided to the \\nstudent . \\nUndergraduate Tuition Exchange Programs \\nCarnegie Mellon University assess es the standard tuition charge for the undergraduate \\ntuition exchange programs. \\nSince Carnegie Mellon assesses the tuition charge, the student can be considered for all \\nforms of institutional, state, and federal aid for which the student may have eligibili ty with \\nthe exception of a ny student employment program. \\nUndergraduate Study Abroad Programs \\nCarnegie Mellon University does not assess the tuition charge for any of the Study Abroad Programs. \\nSince Carnegie Mellon does not assess the tuition charge, the s tudent is not considered \\nfor any institutional grants and scholarships. However, Carnegie Mellon will consider any student participating in an approved Study Abroad Program for all state and federal student aid programs for which the student may have eligi bility with the exception of any \\nstudent employment program. \\nThe U.S. Department of Education and Carnegie Mellon University define an approved Study Abroad Program as one which is part of a contractual agreement between Carnegie Mellon and the host institution. Additionally, courses taken in the Study Abroad Program \\nmust be accepted for transfer to Carnegie Mellon by the Dean of the student's college. \\n52 \\n \\n Undergraduate International Students \\nFor purposes of undergraduate student financial aid, an International Student is defined \\nas someone who is neither a U.S. citizen nor an eligible noncitizen. The U.S. Department of Education defines an eligible noncitizen as: \\n1. An individual who is a permanent resident of the United States (as evidenced by an I -\\n151 or I -551 c ard); or \\n2. An individual who can provide documentation from the U.S. Immigration and \\nNaturalization Service (INS) that s/he is in the United States for other than a temporary \\npurpose with the intention of becoming a citizen or permanent resident of the Unite d \\nStates. \\nAn undergraduate, International Student is ineligible to receive any federal or state \\nstudent financial aid. Additionally, Carnegie Mellon does not award any institutional financial aid funds to undergraduate International Students. \\nFinancial Obligations \\nStudents should pay the amounts due on their E -Bill by the due date on their invoice. Past \\ndue accounts are subject to a 1.5% penalty charge each month until the balance is paid in full. \\nAll financial obligations to the university n eed to be met or future enrollment and other \\nservices may be affected. These obligations include, but are not limited to, tuition, fees, room \\nand board, student health insurance, library or parking fines, or any other charges due to the university. \\nGrading Policies \\nPolicy Statement \\nThis policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses, whether those students are undergraduates, non- degree students or graduate \\nstudents. This policy covers the specifics of Assigning a nd Changing Grades (including \\nFinal and Mid- Semester grades, Incompletes and Conditional Failures), Grading Options \\n(Audit and Pass/Fail), Drop/Withdrawals, Course Repeats, and defines the undergraduate and graduate Grading Standards . \\n53 \\n \\n Questions about gradi ng for a specific course should be addressed to the instructor of the \\ncourse in question. Graduate students with questions about Pass/Fail and \\nDrop/Withdrawal should contact their individual programs. \\nAppeals for an exception to any grading policy may be m ade by t he dean's office of the \\nstudent\\u2019 s home college. \\n1. Definitions \\nCertain terms are used in this document with specific meanings, as defined in this section. \\n\\u2022 Student means any full -time or part- time degree- seeking undergraduate or graduate \\nstudent, or full- time or part- time non -degree student. \\n\\u2022 Non -degree student means a student that is not in a university degree program. \\n\\u2022 Faculty means members of the university's Facul ty Organization as defined in the \\nFaculty Handbook, plus instructors and special faculty appointments (even in the first \\nyear), and part -time faculty. \\n\\u2022 Instructor means a faculty member, teaching assistant, and /or lecturer who is the \\ninstructor of record, as recorded in the Student Information System (SIS). \\n2. Policy Provisions \\nAssigning Grades \\nFinal grades are awarded to each student, in each course scheduled, at the end of the \\nsemester, mini -semester or summer session. All students taking a course at Carn egie \\nMellon must be assigned grades. \\nEnrollment Services will query instructors who do not assign a grade to a student. Copies \\nof the query regarding the lack of grade will be sent to the student, to the dean and to the department head. If the instructor does not assign a letter grade or an incomplete grade within one month of Enrollment Service\\u2019 s query, the department head will be responsible \\nfor ins uring that a grade is assigned. \\nChanging a Grade \\nA student who believes that an assigned grade is incorrect, may request that a final grade \\nbe changed. Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and, for undergraduates , with the approval of the dean\\u2019 s \\noffice of the college/school offering the cours e; for graduate students, department \\napproval is required. The intention of this policy is to insure that, under normal \\n54 \\n \\n circumstances, all students in a class are treated equally and n o student is unduly \\nadvantaged. \\nMid-Semester Grades \\nMid- semester grades provide valuable feedback to students as they assess their \\nperformance in courses. Furthermore, mid -semester grades and the QPA's they generate \\nare used by Deans and advisors in identifying and dealing in a timely way with students in \\nacademic trouble. Therefore it is imperative that mid- semester grades accurately reflect \\nstudent performance and are turned in on time. \\nMid- semester grades are not permanent and are kept only until final grades are recorded. \\nBecause mid -semester grades are not permanent, changes of mid -semester grades as a \\nrule will not be accepted. \\nIncomplete Grades \\nCarnegie Mellon students are expected to complete a course during the academic semester in which the course was taken. However, if the instructor agrees, a grad e of I \\n(incomplete) may be given when a student, for reasons beyond his or her control, has been unable to complete the work of a course, but the work completed to date is of passing quality and the grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that s tudent \\nover other students. \\nIn awarding an I grade, an instructor must specify the requirements for completing the \\nwork and designate a default letter grade where no further work is submitted. Students must complete the required course work no later than t he end of the following academic \\nsemester, or sooner if required by prior agreement. The instructor must record the permanent grade by the last day of the examination period of that following semester, or Enrollment Services will administratively assign th e default grade. \\nPass/Fail Grades \\nUndergraduate students may elect to take a free -elective course pass/fail unless \\nprecluded by the course, the course's department or the student's home department/college. Policies for graduate students vary and students s hould be advised \\nto check with their individual colleges/departments/programs for details. A student must submit a Grade Option Request Form to Enrollment Services indicating the course they are electing as pass/fail before the end of the university's with draw period. This decision is \\nirreversible thereafter. No information regarding the student's decision will be passed on to the instructor. Instructors will submit letter grades, which will automatically be converted to pass/fail. \\n55 \\n \\n A through D work will rec eive credit for units passed and be recorded as P on the \\nstudent's academic record; below D work will receive no credit and will be recorded as N \\non the student's academic record. No quality points will be assigned to P or N units; P or N units will not be factored into the student's QPA. \\nIn exceptional circumstances, departments may ask to designate a course pass/fail or request that the course be evaluated only with letter grades. The College Council must approve designating a course as pass/fail only or as graded only. If such a decision will have an adverse effect on the requirements of any other college, Academic Council must review the decision. The decision to designate a course as graded or pass/fail must be made before the add period for the course and is irreversible thereafter. \\nAudit Grades \\nAuditing is presence in the classroom without receiving academic credit, a pass/fail or a letter grade. The exten t of a student\\u2019 s participation must be arranged and approved by \\nthe course instructor. A student w ishing to audit a course is required to register for the \\ncourse, complete the Course Audit Approval Form, obtain permission of the course instructor and their advisor, and return the form to The HUB prior to the last day to add a course. \\nAny student enrolled full- time (36 units) may audit a course without additional charges. \\nPart-time or non- degree students who choose to audit a course will be assessed tuition at \\nthe regular per -unit tuition rate. \\nDrop/Withdrawal Grades \\nStudents at Carnegie Mellon may drop a course by accessing on- line registration on or \\nbefore the drop deadline as published in the official university calendar. This applies to all courses with the exception of mini -semester courses. Policies for graduate students vary \\nand students should be advised to check with their individual colleges/departments/programs for details. The deadline to drop a mini- semester course \\nis the last day of the second week of the mini -semester course. When a course is dropped \\nby these deadlines, the course is removed and does not appear on the academic record. \\nAfter the deadline to drop, students may withdraw from a course by accessing on -line \\nregistration by the end of the 10th week of class as noted in the academic calendar. After the deadline to drop, a W (withdraw al) grade is assigned and appears on the student's \\nacademic record. W grades do not apply to graduate students except in Tepper and MCS. \\nStudents may use a late drop voucher for a limited number of course drops after the \\ndeadline during the pursuit of thei r degree. This action must be taken through \\nconsultation with their academic advisor or associate dean. Details on the late drop \\n56 \\n \\n voucher process can be found in the Undergraduate Catalog and the Graduate Education \\nwebsite. \\nUndergraduates who are registere d as full- time students as of the 10th day of classes are \\nexpected to remain full- time for the duration of the semester. Full -time is defined as \\nregistered for a minimum of 36 units. Permission to drop below the 36 -unit minimum can \\nonly be granted in extraordinary circumstances by the student's home Associate Dean. \\nUndergraduates who are registered as part -time are also subject to the above deadlines \\nto drop or withdraw from a course. \\nCourse Repeats \\nWhen a course is repeated, all grades will be recorded on the official academic transcript and wi ll be calculated in the student\\u2019s QPA. This is the case regardless if the first grade for \\nthe course is a passing or failing grade. \\nUndergraduate students who wish to repeat a course already passed must obtain approva l from the student's Dean or Department Head. When a student takes a course \\ns/he has already passed, only one set of units will count towards graduation requirements. \\n3. University Grading Standards \\nThis grading standard is for all students classified as seeking an undergraduate degree and special students taking undergraduate courses. Special students taking graduate courses will be graded on the graduate grading scale (see below). \\nGrade Quality Points \\nA 4.0 Excellent \\nB 3.0 Good \\nC 2.0 Satisfactory \\nD 1.0 Passing \\nR 0.0 Failure \\nP Non -factorable Passing \\nN Non -factorable Not Passing \\nO Non -factorable Audit \\nW Non -factorable Withdrawal \\nI Non -factorable Incomplete \\n57 \\n \\n AD Non -factorable Credit granted for work completed at another \\ninstitution or by examination credit. \\n \\nAny +/ - grades received by undergraduate students when taking graduate -level courses \\nwill automatically convert to the corresponding letter grade as listed in the scale above . \\n \\nGrade Quality Points \\nA+ 4.33 \\nA 4.0 \\nA- 3.67 \\nB+ 3.33 \\nB 3.0 \\nB- 2.67 \\nC+ 2.33 \\nC 2.0 \\nC- 1.67 \\nD+ 1.33 \\nD 1.0 \\nR 0.0 Failure \\nS Non -factorable Satisfactory \\nP Non -factorable Passing \\nN Non -factorable Not Passing \\nO Non -factorable Audit \\nW Non -factorable Withdrawal \\nI Non -factorable Incomplete \\nAD Non -factorable Credit granted for work completed at another \\ninstitution or by examination credit. \\n \\nThis grading standard is for all students classified as seeking a graduate degree and \\nspecial students taking graduate courses. \\n58 \\n \\n Students who entered Carnegie Mellon (as graduate students) prior to Fall 1995 follow \\ntheir previous graduate grading standard. Graduate students who take a leave of absence and return to Carnegie Mellon will do so under the 4.33 -point grading sca le. These \\nstudents will have their past semester QPAs recalculated at the time of their return. \\nNo A+ may be given in an H&SS or CIT course. No D or D+ may be given in a Tepper course. Pass/Fail policies for graduate students vary and students should be advised to check with their individual colleges/departments/programs for details.

Any course that a graduate student completes will be gr aded using this scale. This \\nincludes undergraduate courses taken by graduate students, and special students taking graduate courses. \\nHandling Alleged Misconduct In \\n Research Policy\\n \\nStatement \\nCarnegie Mellon University is responsible for the integrity of research conducted at the university. As a community of scholars, in which truth and integrity are fundamental, the university must establish procedures for the investigation of allegations of misconduct of research with due care to protect the rights of those accused, those making the allegations, and the university. Furthermore, federal regulations require the university to have explicit procedures for addressing incidents in which there are allegations of \\nmisconduct in research. \\nIntroduction \\nThis document outlines the procedures to be followed when misconduct in research is alleged at Carnegie Mellon. As defined by the National Science Foundation: \\n[14] \\n\\\"Misconduct means (1) fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other serious deviation \\nfrom accepted practices in proposing, carrying out, or reporting results from research; (2) \\nmaterial failure to comply with Federal r equirements for the protection of researchers, \\nhuman subjects, or the public or for ensuring the welfare of laboratory animals; or (3) \\nfailure to meet other material legal requirements governing research.\\\" \\n \\n14 National Science Foundation. 45 CFR Part 689. \\\"Misconduct in Science and Engineering Research,\\\" Federal Register. Vol. 52. No . \\n126. Wednesday, July 1, 1987, p. 24468. \\n59 \\n \\n To be deemed misconduct for the purposes of this policy, a \\\"material failure to comply \\nwith Federal requirements\\\" or a \\\"failure to meet other material legal requirements\\\" must be intentional or grossly negligent. \\nIn conjunction with the procedures outlined in this policy, the provost is responsible for complying with applicable federal regulations, including notifying sponsoring a gencies at \\nthe appropriate time\\n[15] and keeping those involved, Committees of Inquiry and \\nCommittees of Investigation, well informed with respect to the requirements of these agen cies. If at any time it appears that the possibility exists that the alleged misconduct \\nmight involve a violation of any federal, state or local criminal statute, the university attorney must be consulted immediately to determine further action. \\nAllegation s \\nQuestions about, or suspicions of, misconduct in research should be brought to the attention of the provost for confidential counseling and possible informal resolution. \\nAllegations of misconduct shall be presented to the provost in writing. Anonymous reports will not be accepted. The provost will acknowledge allegations in writing to the \\nclaimant. \\n[16] \\nAfter a review of the allegation, the provost must decide within 15 days whether a Committee of Inquiry is needed and, if so, establish such a committee promptly. The \\nclaimant must be informed, in writing, of the provost's decision. \\nIf a decision is made to establish a Committee of Inquiry, the respondent\\n[17] must be \\ninformed in writing of the allegation, advised of the initiation of the inquiry process, an d \\nasked to provide information. \\nCommittee of Inquiry \\nThe provost shall appoint a three -member Committee of Inquiry. Committee members \\nshould be faculty or staff who, in the judgment of the provost, have the appropriate \\nseniority and knowledge to assess the alleged misconduct and do not have a conflict of \\ninterest that would interfere with an objective review. \\n \\n15 Currently, NSF requires notification when it is decided that a fo rmal investigation will be undertaken; however, it should be \\nborne in mind that guidelines in many agencies are currently under development, so it would be impossible to incorporate such \\nguidelines in this policy. \\n16 \\\"Claimant\\\" and \\\"respondent\\\" are the term s used by the Association of American Universities in their draft document, \\nFramework for Institutional Policies and Procedures for Fraud in Research , August, 1988. We have chosen to use these terms in this \\ndocument. The terms \\\"claimant\\\" and \\\"respondent\\\" i n this policy stand for singular or plural, as the case may require, unless \\nqualified as \\\"individual claimant\\\" or \\\"individual respondent,\\\" respectively. \\n60 \\n \\n The provost shall charge, in writing, the Committee of Inquiry to conduct a discreet inquiry \\nbased on communication with the respondent and the claima nt. The purpose of the \\ninquiry is to determine if there is reason to believe that misconduct has occurred. The inquiry should be limited to activities necessary to determine whether to recommend a formal investigation. \\nThe identities of the respondent and claimant will be kept confidential by members of the committee, if possible. \\nIf a majority of the members of the committee of Inquiry recommend that a formal investigation be conducted, the provost must establish a Committee of Investigation. If only a minority of the members of the Committee of Inquiry recommend a formal investigation, the provost may either dismiss the allegation or establish a Committee of Investigation. \\nIf the Committee of Inquiry determines that the allegations have been made in a capr icious or malicious manner, they will report this to the provost for appropriate action. \\nThe Committee of Inquiry has 30 days to conduct the inquiry. If the inquiry cannot be reasonably completed within 30 days, the Committee may request a 30 -day extension \\nfrom the provost. \\nIf a decision is made to establish a Committee of Investigation, the respondent must be \\ninformed of the identity of the claimant, shown all of the documents and evidence that relate to the charges, and given 15 days to respond prior to initiating the investigation. Sponsoring agencies shall be informed if appropriate or mandated. \\nCommittee of Investigation \\nThe Committee of Investigation shall have five members, none of whom was a member of the Committee of Inquiry. The provost will appoin t two members. The chairmen of the \\nUniversity Research Council, the Faculty Review Committee, and the faculty will each appoint one member. \\nThe provost shall charge, in writing, the Committee of Investigation to conduct a thorough investigation of the alle gation. The committee should have access to all persons and \\ninformation needed to determine the extent to which misconduct has occurred. Otherwise, the investigation should be as confidential as possible. \\nThe Committee of Investigation shall prepare a written report documenting the extent to which misconduct has occurred. This report will be given to the provost, the respondent, the claimant, the chairman of the University Research Council, the chairman of the Faculty \\n61 \\n \\n Review Committee, the chairman of the f aculty, the university ombudsman, and the \\npresident and, if any involved individual is a student, to the dean of Student Affairs. \\nOptionally, the Committee of Investigation may recommend to the provost a course of \\naction based on their findings. \\nThe Commi ttee of Investigation has 120 days to complete the investigation. If the \\ninvestigation cannot be reasonably completed within 120 days, the committee may request a 30 -day extension from the provost. \\nDetermination of Action and Appeal \\nThe provost will transmit to the president of the university the reports of the Committee \\nof Inquiry and the Committee of Investigation together with his recommendation for appropriate action. \\nWhen the provost's recommendation to the president calls for no action to be tak en \\nagainst an individual respondent and the president concurs, as well as when the president declines to accept a recommendation for action, the president shall, at that respondent's request, in writing, address to that respondent a letter identifying the allegations investigated and stating the reasons for the provost's recommendation and/or the president's decision, as appropriate. This letter shall be available for responsible use at the addressee's discretion. It shall not be included in the personnel f ile unless such \\ninclusion is requested, in writing, by the addressee. The president's letter must be formulated, and used by the recipient, so as to preserve the confidentiality of the process, and shall in particular include only information already disclosed to the addressee. \\nFor each individual respondent found responsible for misconduct, the president may impose (or request, in the case of a regular, research, or special faculty member) specific sanctions, including termination of employment for a facul ty or staff member and \\nexpulsion of a student. \\nThe imposition of sanctions is subject to the procedures for approval and/or appeal prescribed by the Appointment and Tenure Policy for a regular, research, or special \\nfaculty member; the Staff Grievance Proce dure for a staff member (or the provisions of a \\nwritten labor agreement for an employee in a bargaining unit); and the provisions of the section on Discipline in the Student Handbook for a student. \\nFollowing completion of the Committee of Investigation's w ork and the provost's \\nrecommendation, when an individual respondent is a faculty member, if the president decides to initiate against that faculty member the procedure for dismissal for cause or for the imposition of another sanction, the procedure is then subject to the Exceptions \\n62 \\n \\n provision of the subsection Procedures of the section entitled Dismissal for Cause and \\nOther Sanctions of the Appointment and Tenure Policy, thus precluding the Ad -Hoc \\nCommittee stage. \\nThe provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this section are also applicable to appropriate action regarding each individual claimant found responsible for allegations made in a capricious or malicious manner. \\nHuman Subjects in Research Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nThe university is committed to the pr otection of the rights and welfare of human subjects \\nin research investigations conducted under the jurisdiction of the university. The university believes that review independent of the investigator is necessary to safeguard the rights and welfare of huma n subjects of research investigations. All research involving \\nhuman subjects is conducted in accordance with federal regulations, including Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations\\n, Part 46 (45 CFR 46). Under federal regulations, human \\nsubjects are defined as: living individual(s) about whom an investigator conducting research obtains (1) data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or (2) identifiable private information. \\nAn Institutional Review Board (IRB) is established under the provost to ensure adequate safeguards. The provost is responsible for the composition of the IRB with respect to: (1) the qualifications of IRB members in terms of educational background and research or other relevant experience, and (2) broad representation of relevant university interests. \\nThis IRB is responsible for reviewing investigational procedures involving human subjects prior to the initiation of the research procedure in reference to (1) the rights and welfare of the individuals involved, (2) the appropriateness of the methods used to obtain informed consent, and (3) the risks and potential benefits of the investigations. The IRB is responsible for determining when additional expertise is required for adequate review and for obtaining that additional expertise. The IRB is further responsible for maintaining records of its review activities and decisions and for ensuring that records o f informed \\nconsent are developed and kept by investigators where appropriate. \\nIt is the responsibility of investigators who plan to use human subjects in research to obtain written consent from the IRB prior to conducting an investigation involving human subjects. It is the investigator's further responsibility to take whatever steps are \\n63 \\n \\n determined necessary for the protection of the subjects, and to meet the reporting \\nrequirements established by the IRB. \\nIntellectual Property Policy \\n1. Purpose \\nThe policy reflects the following goals: \\n\\u2022 To create a university environment that encourages the generation of new knowledge \\nby faculty, staff, and students. \\n\\u2022 To facilitate wide transfer of useful inventions and writings to society. \\n\\u2022 To motivate the development and diss emination of intellectual property by providing \\nappropriate financial rewards to creators and the university, and administrative \\nassistance to creators. \\n\\u2022 To ensure that the financial return from the development of intellectual property does \\nnot distort decisions and operations of the university in a manner contrary to the \\nmission of the university. \\nThe policy is based upon the following principles relating the university to society: \\n\\u2022 The mission of the university remains the generation and dissemination of knowledge. \\n\\u2022 Intellectual property will be generated within the university, and there exists an \\nobligation to disseminate it. An interface is needed if better technology transfer is to be achieved, and the university will provide mechanisms for that function.\\n[17] \\nThe policy is based upon the following principles relating faculty, staff and students to the \\nuniversity. \\n\\u2022 Intellectual property is created by individuals, or by groups of individuals, who are \\nentitled to choose the course of disclosure; acade mic freedom of individuals is a \\nhigher priority than possible financial rewards. \\n\\u2022 There exists an historical tradition allowing authors to retain ownership of intellectual \\nproperty rights from textbooks and works of art. \\n \\n17 This document presumes the existence of a university office to facilitate technology transfer . Such an office would serve as a \\nclearinghouse for contacts with outside partners, would perform patent and copyright tasks, and would develop an effective \\nmarketing capability. \\n64 \\n \\n \\u2022 The university is the support of the whole campus community, and is thereby entitled \\nto share in financial rewards. \\n\\u2022 There should be incentives for all parties to pursue financial rewards together, \\nconsistent with the expressed goals of the policy. The distribution of these rewards \\nshould ref lect, insofar as possible, the creative contributions of the creator, and the \\nresources contributed by and risks assumed by both the creator and the university in developing intellectual property. \\n\\u2022 Since it is frequently difficult to meaningfully assess ris ks, resources and potential \\nrewards, negotiated agreements are to be encouraged whenever possible. \\n2. Definitions \\nCertain terms are used in this document with specific meanings, as defined in this section. \\nThese definitions do not necessarily conform to c ustomary usage. \\n\\u2022 Intellectual Property includes any patentable invention, any copyrightable subject \\nmatter, or trade secret. It also includes works of art, and inventions or creations that might normally be developed on a proprietary basis. \\n\\u2022 University means Carnegie Mellon. \\n\\u2022 Student means any full -time or part- time graduate or undergraduate student, \\nregardless of whether the student receives financial aid from the university or from outside sources. It is the responsibility of students who are also employees of other outside entities to resolve any conflicts between this policy and provisions of \\nagreements with their employers prior to beginning any undertaking at the university that will involve the development of intellectual property. \\n\\u2022 Faculty means members of the university's Facul ty Organization as defined in the \\nFaculty Handbook, plus instructors and special faculty appointments (even in the first year), and part -time faculty. \\n\\u2022 Staff means any employee of the university other than students and faculty as defined \\nabove. If a student is also a part- time university employee, he is considered as staff \\nwith regard to intellectual property developed as a result of his employment, and as a student with regard to other intellectual property. A full- time non -faculty employee \\nwho is also taki ng one or more courses is considered to be staff. Visitors to the \\nuniversity who make substantial use of university resources are considered as staff with respect to any intellectual property arising from such use. (The distinction between faculty and staf f does not affect intellectual property rights except for \\nrepresentation on the Intellectual Property Adjudication Committee [see Section 5]). \\n65 \\n \\n \\u2022 Creator means any person or persons who create an item of intellectual property. \\n\\u2022 Net proceeds to the university means all proceeds received by the university on \\nintellectual property that it assigns, sells or licenses, minus any application, litigation, \\ninterference, or marketing costs directly attributable to the intellectual property being \\nlicensed. Deducted costs shall be reasonable and fair, and shall be properly disclosed; \\nthe sources and amounts of compensation shall also be properly disclosed. \\n\\u2022 Net proceeds to the creator means all proceeds received by the creator from \\nintellectual property owned by him that he sells, assigns or licenses, less the costs of \\napplication, legal protection, or litigation, interference, travel and other marketing costs directly attributable to the intellectual property being exploited. Such net proceeds do not include compensation leg itimately received by the creator for \\nconsulting services or interest or other return on invested labor or capital. Deducted costs shall be reasonable and fair, and shall be properly disclosed; the sources and amounts of compensation shall also be properly disclosed. \\n\\u2022 Substantial use of university facilities means extensive unreimbursed use of major \\nuniversity laboratory, studio or computational facilities, or human resources. The use of these facilities must be important to the creation of the intellectual property; merely incidental use of a facility does n ot constitute substantial use, nor does extensive use \\nof a facility commonly available to all faculty or professional staff (such as libraries and offices), nor does extensive use of a specialized facility for routine tasks. Use will be considered \\\"extensi ve\\\" and facilities will be considered \\\"major\\\" if similar use of similar \\nfacilities would cost the creator more than $5000 (five thousand dollars) in constant 1984 dollars if purchased or leased in the public market. Creators wishing to directly reimburse the University for the use of its facilities must make arrangements to do so \\nbefore the level of facilities usage for a particular intellectual property becomes substantial. (This provision is not intended to override any other department or university policy concerning reimb ursement for facilities usage.) \\nIn General: \\nIn any given year the equivalent figure for a particular amount of money in constant 1984 dollars will be obtained by multiplying that amount of money by the ratio of the most recent quarterly Disposable Personal Income Deflator divided by the average monthly Disposable Personal Income Deflator for the year 1984. \\nAs used in this policy, the masculine gender includes the feminine gender, singular or plural, wherever appropriate. \\n66 \\n \\n 3. Policy Provis ions \\nThis section states the policies concerning ownership of intellectual property created at \\nthe university. In order of precedence, ownership of intellectua l property shall be as \\nfollows: \\n3-1. Externally Sponsored Work \\nOwnership Provisions: Intellectual property created as a result of work conducted under \\nan agreement between an external sponsor and the university that specifies the ownership of such intellectual property shall be owned as specified in said agreement. If the university declares itself to be a sponsor, but does not declare itself to be the owner of \\nthe intellectual property, ownership shall be determined in accordance with \\n3-6-4 below. \\nProcedural Provisions: It is the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research of the \\nuniversity to inform each person whose intellectual property rights are limited by an \\nexternally sponsored contract of the intellectual property provisions of that contract in advance of the beginning of work thereon. Such notice is to be in writing and the university m ay require written acknowledgment of such provisions by any person working \\non externally sponsored projects. A summary of external sponsorship agreements limiting the intellectual property rights of potential creators will be maintained by the Office of Sponsored Research and will be available to the general university community. \\nIf the university fails to notify a creator, effectively and in advance, of limitations imposed on his intellectual property rights by external sponsorship agreements, the creator is entitled to receive from the university 50% (fifty percent) of the net proceeds to the university resulting from his intellectual property. \\n3-2. Internally Sponsored Work \\nOwnership Provisions: When the university provides funds or facilities for a particular \\nproject to the extent of substantial use, it may also choose to designate itself as sponsor of that work. The university may declare itself the owner of intellectual property resulting from said work. In such cases the university must specify in advance the disposition of any \\nintellectual property rights arising from the project. If the university declares itself to be a sponsor, but does not declare itself the owner of the intellectual property, ownership shall be determined in accordance with \\n3-6-4 below. \\nProcedural Provisions: It is the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research of the \\nuniversity to inform each person whose intellectual property rights are limited by internally spo nsored work of the intellectual property ownership rights specified by the \\nuniversity as to that work in advance of the beginning of work thereon. Such notice is to \\n67 \\n \\n be in writing and the university may require written acknowledgment of such provisions \\nby any person working on internally sponsored projects. A summary of work for which \\nuniversity sponsorship limits the intellectual property rights of potential creators will be maintained by the Office of Sponsored Research and will be available to the general university community. \\nIf the university fails to notify a creator, effectively and in advance, of limitations imposed on his intellectual property rights by internal university sponsorship, the creator is entitled to receive from the university 50% (fifty percent) of the net proceeds to the university \\nresulting from his intellectual property. \\n3-3. Individual Agreements \\nOwnership Provisions: Intellectual property which is the subject of a specific agreement \\nbetween the university and the creator(s) thereof shall be owned as provided in said agreement. Such agreements by the university and the faculty are encouraged. \\nProcedural Provisions: Except where limited by external sponsorship agreements, \\ncreators and the university may negotiate individual agreements to govern ownership of intellectual property regardless of the applicability of any other provision hereof. \\n3-4. Intellectual Property Created Within Scope of Employment \\nOwnership Provisions: Intellectual property created by university employees who were \\nemployed specifically to produce a particular intellectual property shall be owned by the \\nuniversity if said intellectual property was created within the normal scope of their employment. Faculty are presumed not to be hired to produce a particular intellec tual \\nproperty. On the other hand, computer programs written on the job by staff computer programmers would fall under this provision. \\n3-5. Public Dedication \\nOwnership Provisions: Except when limited by subparts 3-1, 3-2, 3-3 or 3-4 above, the \\ncreator of an y intellectual property may choose to place his or her creation in the public \\ndomain. In such cases both the creator and the university waive all ownership rights to said property. \\nProcedural Provisions: Creators wishing to place their intellectual propert y in the public \\ndomain are responsible for ascertaining that the right to public dedication of that intellectual property is not limited by any external agreement, university sponsorship arrangement or terms of employment as described in Provisions \\n3-1, 3-2 or 3-3 above. \\nThe university provost will provide such a determination in writing upon request by the \\ncreator. It is also the creator's responsibility to ensure that disclosure does not include \\n68 \\n \\n valuable intellectual property owned by others. (This provis ion does not release the \\nuniversity from its general obligation to notify creators of limitations to intellectual \\nproperty rights specified in Provisions 3-1 and 3-2 above.) \\nTo facilitate the actual transfer of knowledge of the intellectual property to the public at \\nlarge, the creator shall provide the university with a complete description and documentation of the property placed in the public domain, specifically including a copy of the property in the case of printed material, and complete machine -readab le source \\ncode in the case of software. All such material provided to the university will be placed in the University Library and made available to the public at large. The university will take appropriate action on a regular basis to publicize summary des criptions of intellectual \\nproperty recently placed in the public domain. The university will also provide any member of the general public copies of such material on a cost -recovery basis. \\nThe provisions of this section do not apply to the normal scholarly or creative publication processes unless the creator intends to waive all proprietary rights to the publication. \\n3-6. In General \\nUnless governed by subparts 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4 or 3-5 above, ownership of intellectual \\nproperty created at the univer sity shall be determined as follows: \\n3-6-1. Traditional Rights Retained \\nOwnership Provisions: In keeping with academic traditions at the university, the creator \\nretains all rights to the following types of intellectual property, without limitation: books (including textbooks), educational courseware, articles, non- fiction, novels, poems, \\nmusical w orks, dramatic works including any accompanying music, pantomimes and \\nchoreographic works, pictorial, graphic and sculptural works, motion pictures and other similar audio -visual works, and sound recordings, regardless of the level of use of \\nuniversity fac ilities. This provision does not include computer software (other than \\neducational courseware) or data bases. \\nProcedural Provisions: The types of intellectual property listed in the preceding \\nparagraph share the attribute that they display information or v isual or auditory \\nappearances which are fully revealed to the purchaser or consumer. Thus, for example, \\nsource code listings would also be considered within this category. On the other hand, \\nmost computer software and data bases do not share this attribute ; they are \\ncharacterized by their capacity to perform tasks. Because of their utilitarian nature, \\nownership rights with respect thereto are governed by 3-6-3 or 3-6-4. Educational \\ncourseware is included in this provision in all cases because of its role in furthering the \\nprimary educational mission of the university. \\n69 \\n \\n This provision applies regardless of any university sponsorship of the work, and it may \\nbe modified only by a specific prior agreement between the creator and the university. The use of univers ity-owned computers and other facilities in the preparation of books \\nand similar works does not alter this provision, though other university policies may limit such use or require reimbursement to the university. Similarly, the use of externally sponsored resources does not alter this provision, unless the creator is effectively \\nnotified in advance of such limitations to his rights in accordance with \\n3-1. \\n3-6-2. No Substantial Use of University Facilities \\nOwnership Provisions: The creator owns all intellec tual property created without \\nsubstantial use of university facilities, including intellectual property rights in co mputer \\nsoftware and data bases. \\n3-6-3. Substantial Use of University Facilities - No External or Internal Sponsorship \\nOwnership of intellect ual property created with substantial use of university facilities, \\nbut not directly arising from externally sponsored work, or from work for which the university has declared itself as sponsor, shall be determined as set forth hereinafter depending on whe ther the creator or the university develops said property. \\n3-6-3-1. Development by Creator \\nOwnership Provisions: The creator originally owns intellectual property created with \\nsubstantial use of university facilities but no external or internal sponsorship, and retains said ownership by commercial development of said property subject to the following: (i) the university shall receive 15% (fifteen percent) of the net proceeds to the creator above $25,000 (twenty -five thousand dollars) in constant 1984 dollar s \\nfrom all sources (in the case of patents and copyrights, this provision shall be limited to the life of the patent or copyright), and (ii) the university shall receive a perpetual, non- exclusive, non- transferrable, royalty free license to use said intellectual property. \\nIn the case of software, this license includes access by specified university personnel to the source listings, and the university shall require each person to whom a disclosure is made to execute in advance a binding confidentiality agree ment in favor \\nof and enforceable by the creator. If the intellectual property is created solely by a student or students, the creator is exempt from the obligation to pay to the university a fraction of his net proceeds, but not from the provision of this paragraph for a non- exclusive license to the university. \\n70 \\n \\n Procedural Provisions: If the creator develops an intellectual property that is covered \\nby this provision, he must make full and fair disclosure to the University of all such \\nsources of compensation relating to that intellectual property. \\n3-6-3-2. Development by the University \\nOwnership Provisions: When intellectual property is created with substantial use of \\nuniversity facilities, but not directly arising from sponsored research, the creator will \\noriginally retain the rights to the property, provided that he desires to commercially \\ndevelop the property himself or to make it available to the public. If, however, the \\ncreator elects not to commercially develop same or fails to show diligence in \\npursuing such development, then the ownership rights to that property may be acquired by the university. Intellectual property acquired by the university in this fashion will be treated as in \\n3-6-4-1 below. \\nProcedural Provisions: At the time the intellectual proper ty is disclosed to the \\nuniversity's provost as required under Section 4-1, or at any time thereafter, the \\nuniversity may request that the creator decide whether he will develop the intellectual property or will grant the rights to the university, and execu te documents \\nto pass on the title. Such a decision must be made within one year of the request or the creator will automatically lose his rig hts in favor of the university. \\n3-6-4. Substantial Use of University Facilities - External or Internal Sponsorship \\nOwnership of intellectual property created with substantial use of university facilities and directly arising from work sponsored under an agreement between an external sponsor and the university, or from work for which the university has declared itself a \\nsponsor, but for which neither the external sponsor nor the university have specified the ownership of resulting intellectual property shall be determined as set forth hereinafter depending on whether the creator or the uni versity develops said property. \\n3-6-4-1. Development by University \\nOwnership Provisions: The University originally owns intellectual property created \\nwith substantial use of university facilities provided by an external agreement or internal university sponsorship and retains said owners hip by commercial \\ndevelopment of said property, subject to the following: in all cases, the creator shall receive 50% (fifty percent) of the net proceeds to the university. \\nProcedural Provisions: When an intellectual property is created with substantial use \\nof university resources provided by an external research contract or a specific university sponsorship agreement, and when that contract or agreement either does \\n71 \\n \\n not specify the disposition of the intellectual property rights arising from that \\nsponsorship, or it permits the university and/or creator to retain or acquire such intellectual property rights, the university will originally retain the rights to such intellectual property. \\n3-6-4-2. Dev elopment by Creator \\nOwnership Provisions: When intellectual property is created with substantial use of \\nuniversity facilities provided by external or internal sponsorship, the university will originally retain the rights to the property, provided that it desires to commercially develop the proper ty or to make it available to the public. If, however, the university \\nelects not to commercially develop same or fails to show diligence in such development, the ownership rights to that property may be acquired by the creator. Intellectual property acquir ed by the creator in this fashion will be treated as in \\n3-6-3-\\n1 above. This assignment of rights to the creator may be prohibited by the terms of \\nan external sponsorship agreement with the university or by an internal university sponsorship declaration, bu t in such cases the creator must be notified in advance, \\nas in Provisions \\n3-1 and 3-2. \\nProcedural Provisions: At the time the intellectual property is disclosed to the \\nuniversity's provost as required by Section 4-1, or at any time thereafter, the creator \\nmay request that the university decide whether it will commercially develop the intellectual property or execute an assignment of the intellectual property rights to the creator. Such a decision must be made within 120 (one hundred twenty) days of the requ est or the university automatically waives its rights in favor of the creator, \\nand it must execute an assignment of these rights to the creator. \\n3-6-5. Consulting Agreements \\nOwnership Provisions: Work done by individuals as consultants to outside firms is \\npresumed not to involve unreimbursed substantial use of university facilities, and the rights to intellectual property created under consulting agreements are retained by the outside firms or the individual as specified by the terms of the consulting agree ment \\nand the terms of Provision \\n3-6-2 above. \\nProcedural Provisions: Under university policy consulting work must not make \\nsubstantial unreimbursed use of university facilities except by explicit prior agreement. Any member of the university community who i s engaged in consulting work or in \\nbusiness is responsible for ensuring that provisions in his agreements are not in conflict with this policy of the university or with the university's commitments. The university's Innovation Transfer Office will, upon re quest, provide assistance in this respect. The \\n72 \\n \\n university's rights and the individual's obligations to the university are in no way \\nabrogated or limited by the terms of such agreements. Each creator of intellectual property should make his obligations to t he university clear to those with whom he \\nmakes such agreements and should ensure that they are provided with a current statement of the university's intellectual property policy. Appropriate sample contract wording to cover various possible external consulting arrangements shall be available from the university provost. \\n4. General Procedures \\n4-1. \\nThe creator of any intellectual property that is or might be owned by the university under this policy is required to make reasonably prompt written disclosure o f the work to the \\nuniversity's provost, and to execute any document deemed necessary to perfect legal rights in the university and enable the university to file patent applications and applications for copyright registration when appropriate. This disclosu re to the provost \\nshould be made at the time when legal protection for the creation is contemplated, and it must be made before the intellectual property is sold, used for profit, or disclosed to the public. Whenever legal protection for intellectual prope rty is anticipated all persons \\nengaged in such creative activity are encouraged to keep regular notebooks and records. \\n4-2. \\nWhenever the university undertakes commercial development it shall do so, if possible, in a fashion that provides for the widest pos sible dissemination, avoiding suppression of \\ninventions from which the public might otherwise benefit, providing for non -exclusive \\nlicensing at reasonable royalties, and giving consideration to more favorable or royalty -\\nfree licensing to non- profit charita ble institutions, minority businesses or enter prises in \\ndeveloping countries. \\n4-3. \\nThe university's share of any proceeds under this policy will be used to reimburse the \\nUniversity for its expenses for commercial development of intellectual property. Any \\nadditional return to the university will be used to further the academic purposes of all the \\ndisciplines of the entire university. \\n5. Resolution of Disputes \\nThis policy constitutes an understanding which is binding on the university and on the \\nfaculty, sta ff, and students upon whom it is effective according to the terms of Section 6 \\n73 \\n \\n below, as a condition for participating in research programs at the university or for the \\nuse of university funds or facilities. \\nAny question of interpretation or claim arising out of or relating to this policy, or dispute as to ownership rights of intellectual property under this policy, will be settled by the following procedure: \\n1. The issue must first be submitted to the university's Intellectual Property \\nAdjudication Committee in the form of a letter setting forth the grievance or issue to \\nbe resolved. The committee will review the matter and then advise the parties of its \\ndecision within 60 days of submission of the letter. \\n2. If any of the parties to the dispute is not satisfied with the committee's decision, the \\nparty may seek binding arbitration in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and in accordance \\nwith the Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment upon \\nthe award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having \\njurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator(s) will give some weight to the decision of the \\nIntellectual Property Adjudication Committee in reaching a decision. The losing party \\nof the arbitration hearing will pay for all costs of the arbitration unless the arbitrator(s) specifies otherwise. \\nThe Intellectual Property Adjudication Committee will consist of a chair who is a member \\nof the tenured faculty, four other members of the faculty, and four other members representi ng, respectively, the university administration, the technical staff, and the \\ngraduate and undergraduate student bodies. Initially, half of the members of the committee (including the chair) will be appointed for two -year terms of office, and the \\nremaining half will be appointed for a one -year term. After one year new members of the \\ncommittee will be appointed for two -year terms of office. The chair will be appointed by \\nthe chair of the Faculty Senate, with the advice and consent of the Faculty Senate Execu tive Committee, and the remaining eight members of the committee will be \\nappointed by the president of the university or his designee. At all times at least one of the faculty members will have had significant practical experience with intellectual property development and exploitation. The faculty members appointed by the president of the university will be selected from a list of nominees prepared by the Faculty Senate or its designated committee and nominees with experience in intellectual property devel opment will be identified as such by the Faculty Senate. The staff representative will \\nbe selected from a list of nominees prepared by Staff Council, and the administration representative will be named directly by the president of the university or his des ignee. \\nThe graduate student representative will be selected from a list of nominees prepared by \\n74 \\n \\n the Graduate Student Organization. The undergraduate representative will be chosen \\nfrom a list of nominees prepared by the Student Senate. The committee will us e the \\nguidelines set forth in this policy to decide upon a fair resolution of any dispute . \\nIf possible, the committee will also provide on request informal advisory opinions to creators and the university indicating how it is likely to interpret the provis ions of this \\npolicy as it applies to special cases. \\n6. Effective Date of Policy \\nThis policy will become effective August 27, 1985. Once effective this policy will be binding on new faculty, administration, and staff when hired, and on graduate and undergr aduate \\nstudents when admitted. Current faculty and staff will also become bound by this policy when they sign new employment contracts as the result of the renewal of limited -term \\nappointments or promotion. Other university personnel, including tenured fac ulty, and \\ncurrent staff and students may choose to become bound by this policy for future and pending intellectual property by voluntary written consent. Unless the creator and the university agree to a different arrangement, intellectual property that is already partially developed at the time this policy becomes effective will be treated according to the provisions of the patent policy by which the creator is currently bound. Similarly, members of the university working under contracts signed before the e ffective date of \\nthis policy who do not choose to accept this policy will remain bound by the patent policies that already apply to them. With respect to intellectual property developed during the course of employment at the university, this policy shall c ontinue to be binding on any \\nperson whose relationship with the university becomes terminated. The university should take all administrative steps necessary to ensure that employees and students sign, upon initial employment, registration or at other appro priate times, forms that indicate their \\nacceptance of this policy. \\n7. Amendments of the Policy \\nAmendments of this policy may be proposed by the Faculty Senate, Staff Council or university administration. Proposed amendments must be approved by a two -thirds \\nmajority of votes in the Faculty Senate and subsequently approved by a simple majority of votes cast in a referendum administered by the Faculty Senate that is open to all members of the faculty as defined by this policy and to the exempt staff, provided that this majority constitutes at least 25% (twenty -five percent) of those eligible to vote. This \\nreferendum must be preceded by an opportunity for public discussion open to all interested faculty, administration, staff and students. Amendments that are s upported by \\nthe faculty and staff must then be approved by the president of the university and \\n75 \\n \\n adopted by the university trustees. Once adopted, amendments will become binding on \\nnew faculty, administration, and staff when hired, on existing faculty and staff when they sign new employment contracts, and on graduate and undergraduate students when admitted. Other university personnel, including tenured faculty, and current staff and students may choose to become bound by this policy for future and pending in tellectual \\nproperty by voluntary written consent. Intellectual property that is already developed or under development at the time that an amendment to the policy is ratified will not be bound by the terms of the amendment without the voluntary written consent of both the creator and the university. \\nLibrary Policies\\n \\nConduct \\n\\u2022 Silence cell phones.

For students who are seriously \\nill, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs (412 -268- 2075) should be contacted so that the \\nstudent's academic area and /or professor may be contacted. \\nPrenatal Radiation Exposure\\n Policy \\nStatement \\nCarnegie Mellon University (Carnegie Mellon) complies with federal regulations to \\nminimize potentially damaging ionizing radiation exposure to the embryos/fetuses of declared pregnant women working in radiologically restricted areas of the university. \\nTo ensure compliance, this policy mandate s training for all employees and students who \\nwork in radiologically restricted areas regarding the effects of radiation on a developing embryo/fetus. It also mandates a procedure, to be implemented by the radiation safety officer, for ensuring that the radiation exposure of a woman who officially declares her pregnancy does not exceed the level set by federal regulations. \\nInformation and Training \\nThe radiation safety officer shall provide training sessions in which all students and employees, including sup ervisors, who are to work in restricted radiation areas are \\ninformed, orally and in writing, about this Prenatal Radiation Exposure Policy and about potential radiation and non -radiation effects on a developing embryo/fetus. At these \\nsessions, attendees ar e given the opportunity to have questions answered. The radiation \\nsafety officer may, at his or her discretion, administer an oral and/or written exam in order to confirm attendees' understanding of the subject matter. \\nThe radiation safety officer obtains from each attendee a signed acknowledgment of understanding of the Prenatal Radiation Exposure Policy. No employee or student may enter a radiologically restricted area before attending such a training session and signing such an acknowledgment of understanding. \\n77 \\n \\n Any declared pregnant employee or student who performs work that results in radiation \\nexposure at other, non- Carnegie Mellon University locations is responsible for informing \\nthe Radiation Saf ety Office of those activities. \\nDeclaration of Pregnancy \\nAny employee or student who works in a radiologically restricted area of the university and determines she is pregnant may officially declare her pregnancy to the radiation safety officer. To be considered an official declaration of pregnancy, this must be in \\nwriting and contain the estimated date of conception. An official declaration of pregnancy form can be obtained from the radiation safety officer. \\nA pregnant woman has no obligation to officially declare her pregnancy. \\nLimiting Exposure \\nUpon receiving an official declaration of pregnancy, the radiation safety officer shall work with the declared pregnant woman's supervisor to review the work being performed by the declared pregnant woman and determine whether exposure is likely to exceed 500 milligrams during the pregnancy and/or likely to substantially vary from month to month \\nduring the pregnancy. If exposure greater than 500 millirems or significant variation is \\ndetermined to be likely, the radiation safety officer and supervisor shall identify and implement appropriate precautions and engineering controls to limit radiation dose \\nand/or decrease month- to-month variations. \\nThe radiation safety officer shall also, upon receiving an official declaration of pregnancy, complete a dose assessment on the decl ared pregnant woman, including sending her \\nwhole body radiation dosimeter to an approved laboratory for processing, and possibly \\nincluding bioassay by urinalysis. The radiation safety officer shall communicate to the \\ndeclared pregnant woman the results of the dose assessment. \\nOnce a month, the radiation safety officer shall monitor the external occupational dose to a declared pregnant woman using a whole body radiation dosimeter, unless the radiation safety officer considers it unlikely that the embryo/fetu s will receive, from sources outside \\nthe body of the declared pregnant woman, a dose in excess of 100 milligrams during the \\ncourse of the pregnancy. \\nThe radiation safety officer shall monitor the occupational intake, by bioassay if necessary, \\nof radioactiv e material by a declared pregnant woman, unless the radiation safety officer \\nconsiders it unlikely that the declared pregnant woman will receive a \\\"Committed Effective Dose Equivalent\\\" in excess of 100 milligrams during the course of the pregnancy, in \\n78 \\n \\n acco rdance with Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, \\\"Standards for Protection \\nAgainst Radiation.\\\" \\nIf the declared pregnant woman's exposure approaches 350 milligrams prior to the end of \\nthe gestation period, the radiation safety officer shall recommend to the declared \\npregnant woman and her work supervisor that she reduce her use of radioactive materials. If the declared pregnant woman's exposure reaches or exceeds 450 milligrams \\nprior to the end of the gestation period, the radiation safety officer shall notify her \\nsupervisor, remove her radiation dosimeters and rescind her authorization to use radioactive material for the remainder of her pregnancy. \\nDeclared pregnant women desiring to further limit their exposure may do so. Any resulting changes in work routine are to be coordina ted with their work supervisor. \\nRecords \\nThe radiation safety officer shall maintain all official declarations of pregnancy and exposure records in accordance with Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, \\\"Standards for Protection Against Radiation.\\\" \\nReferences \\nTitle 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 19, \\\"Notices, Instructions, and Reports to \\nWorkers: Inspection and Investigations.\\\" \\nTitle 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, \\\"Standards for Protection Against \\nRadiation.\\\" \\nProcedure for the Appeal of Grades and Academic Actions for \\nUndergraduate Students \\nIn the event a student believes an assigned grade or an imposed academic action is incorrect or not appropriate, the student may follow the processes outlined below to seek prompt and equitable resolution of the matter. \\nIf a student believes a grade has been incorrectly assigned, the student should: \\n1. Present the case to the faculty member responsible for the course, providing all \\nsupporting data concerning the nature of the discrepancy. This action should be taken \\nas soon as possible but no later than one year after the final course grade was issued. \\n2. If, after a decision is rendered, the student believes that his or her concerns have not been adequately resolved , the student may pursue a formal appeal with the department \\n79 \\n \\n responsible for the course. To appeal to the department, a student must present a \\nwritten statement detailing the grounds for the appeal with appropriate documentation \\nto the department head of the department responsible for the course. This appeal must \\nbe within seven (7) days of the faculty member's decision. The department head will \\nprovide a written decision, including the basis for it, within thirty (30) days, or as soon thereafter as practical. \\n3. If the student is not satisfied with the department head's resolution, the student may \\npursue the appeal at the college level. To appeal at the college level, the student must \\npresent copies of all documents originally sent to the faculty member and department \\nhead, along with a formal letter of appeal, to the dean of the college responsible for the \\ncourse. This appeal must be submitted within seven (7) days of the department head's decision. The dean, or the dean's designate, will review the appeal an d will render a \\nwritten decision, including the basis for it, within thirty (30) days, or as soon thereafter as practical. \\nIf a student believes an academic action is inconsistent with the policies of the college, a \\nstudent should: \\n1. Submit a formal written appeal to the associate dean of the college responsible for the decision, with a copy to the dean, requesting review of the action including all relevant materials to substantiate the inconsistency in policy and to support their concerns. \\n2. The dean of the c ollege, or the dean's designate, will review the appeal and issue a \\ndecision and the basis for it within 30 days. \\nIf, after carrying out the steps of either process described above, the student believes that \\nthe matter has not been adequately resolved, or if no decision has been rendered by the appropriate date, the student may appeal at the university level. To appeal at the university level, the student must present copies of all documents and a formal letter of appeal to the provost. The provost or another designated university officer will respond in writing with a final resolution, including the basis for it, within thirty (30) days, or as soon thereafter as practical. \\n80 \\n \\n \\nResearch Proposals: Government, Corporations and Foundations \\nPolicy \\nPolicy Statement \\nSponsored research is an important part of the mission of the university and accounts for \\na significant portion of the university's expenditures in a given year. The large amount of research that is supported by government, industry and foundations brings with it a myriad of constantly changing legal, financial and administrative requirements which must be taken into account. Because of the complexity of all these factors, it is important that all proposals, contracts and agreements related to res earch activities be reviewed \\ncentrally to ensure compliance with government regulations and university policies. \\nSignatures and Approvals \\nIn general, research proposals require two sets of signatures: those required by the funding organization and those required by Carnegie Mellon. No proposal should be sent out of the university without the appropriate signatures. \\nAll research proposals to the government and to corporations should be circulated internally and should be accompanied by a Carnegie Mellon Proposal Routing and Sign -off \\nSheet. The sign -off sheet ensures that everyone involved in the process has had the \\nopportunity to review the proposal. \\nThe following signatures are required on the sign- off sheet: \\n\\u2022 Principal investigators: their signatures state that they understand their commitments \\nto the project and agree to meet their obligations as set forth in the proposal. \\n\\u2022 Deans and the department heads: their signatures attest that they support the \\nproposal and that all matters relating to space, fa cilities and personnel can be resolved \\nwithin the department and the college. In instances of joint proposals, signatures from all department heads and deans are required. \\n\\u2022 Signatures from the Office of Sponsored Research and Provost's Office indicate that the proposal and the budget have been reviewed and that they meet the requirements of both the university and the potential sponsor. \\nResearch proposals to foundations - whether initiated within the college or the \\nDevelopment Office - must also be reviewed and signed by the Provost's Office. \\n81 \\n \\n Negotiation of the Award \\nAfter an award is made to the university, the Office of Sponsored Research will enter into \\nsponsored research or contract negotiations. The principal investigator will be responsible for negotiat ing technical aspects of the agreement. The remainder of the negotiations will \\nbe the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research or the Office of the Associate \\nProvost for Research and Academic Administration. All research agreements must be \\nsigned by either the provost or the associate provost for research and academic \\nadministration. No other personnel are authorized to commit the university to a research \\nagreement. \\nRestricted Research Policy \\nStatement \\nUniversities have two primary purposes: to cr eate knowledge and to disseminate \\nknowledge. Carnegie Mellon University recognizes the importance of open intellectual communication within a research group, within the university, and within the larger community outside. Ideally, all units of the university would disseminate the results of research as quickly and as widely as possible. Some members or units of the university, however, desire to do research that may be difficult or impossible without restrictions or without access to classified or proprieta ry materials. \\nThere exists, therefore, a tension between the university's goal of disseminating knowledge freely and the desire on the part of some of its members to conduct restricted research on important problems. The university intends to guarantee the academic \\nfreedom of all faculty members to do research in their own manner on topics of their own choosing, provided that such research is consistent with the overall purposes of the university. \\nThis policy seeks to resolve the tension between the desire to participate in restricted research and the desire to maintain the open atmosphere of the university by confining restricted research to semi- autonomous units, which are not associated with any \\nacademic departments. It thereby establishes the principle that restricted research is inappropriate at Carnegie Mellon University except in the semi- autonomous units. \\nThis policy does not attempt to anticipate all possible concerns about restricted research. \\nIn some cases, decisions will need to be made about particular research projects to which the application of particular policy guidelines are not clear. In choosing to accept or decline such projects, the university will weigh the potential of a project for generating \\n82 \\n \\n and disseminating new knowledge, for the be nefit of society, against the project's \\npotential for adversely affecting the climate for research conducted in a free and open \\nenvironment. While this policy sets no explicit limits on the extent of classified research permitted in the semi -autonomous uni ts, it is not the intent of the policy to encourage any \\nunit of the university to engage in classified research as a primary ongoing activity. Indeed, it is expected that classified projects will never represent more than a small fraction of the total rese arch effort in any unit. \\nDefinitions \\n\\u2022 Research: all projects and investigations involving the creation of new knowledge of a \\ntheoretical or practical nature. The term \\\"research\\\" as used here encompasses both \\n\\\"research\\\" and \\\"development\\\" as they are commonly defined. \\n\\u2022 Classified research: research, the free dissemination of the results of which is deemed \\nto jeopardize national security. The federal government controls access to the environment in which such research is performed, restricts discussions about th e work \\nin progress to individuals with clearance and a \\\"need to know,\\\" and limits publication \\nof research, results or access to data needed to verify results, for a specified period of \\ntime. \\n\\u2022 Proprietary research: research that results in intellectual prope rty that is owned by \\nentities other than Carnegie Mellon University. Such entities may wish to market products derived from inventions or ideas that are developed at the university. They \\nmight, therefore, desire to fund projects which restrict access to da ta and to \\ndiscussions about work in progress to individuals with a \\\"need to know,\\\" and to seek, for a specified period of time, a delay in publication of research results or data needed \\nto verify results. Such entities may also provide access to proprietar y material, which \\nresearchers must agree not to include in publications. \\n\\u2022 Publication: oral or written dissemination. \\n\\u2022 Restricted research: includes all classified research, and any proprietary or other \\nresearch that requires more than a six month delay in publication of the research results. \\n\\u2022 Semi -autonomous units: units of the university specifically so designated by the \\npresident, after con sultation with the URC and the Faculty Senate, currently the Mellon \\nInstitute and the Software Engineering Institute. \\n\\u2022 Non -autonomous units: all university entities other than semi- autonomous units. \\n83 \\n \\n Restricted Research in Non -Autonomous Units \\nIt is the policy of Carnegie Mellon that restricted research is inappropriate and, therefore, \\nnot permitted within its non -autonomous units. \\nIt is also the policy of Carnegie Mellon not to permit involvement of students in projects which carry restrictions that may impede their progress toward a degree. Therefore, \\nstudents should not be involved in contracts that require the delay of a student's \\npublication of research results when such results are intended for use in obtaining \\nacademic credit, except that a sponsor may require a delay of thirty days for review of publications for removal of proprietary information that was provided by the sponsor for the conduct of the research. \\nProprietary research is allowed within non -autonomous units provided it is subject to \\nlimitations (excluding students' publications as noted above) no more stringent than the \\nfollowing: \\n\\u2022 A sponsor may request a delay of up to six months in publication so that steps may be \\ntaken to secure intellectual property rights to inventions or ideas developed under the \\ncontract. \\n\\u2022 A sponsor may require a delay of thirty days for review of publications for removal of proprietary information which was provided for the conduct of the research. \\nConsiderations for Faculty/Researchers \\nThe university recognizes tha t problems arise in both restricted research and research \\nthat is not itself restricted but that involves access to classified or propriety information or \\nmaterials (hereinafter, restricted materials). Researchers may also have access to restricted materia ls when serving as consultants. Access to restricted materials gives rise \\nto concerns about limitations on researchers' freedom to communicate. In such instances, researchers must exercise considerable judgment to conduct their research in an open environm ent while protecting the restricted materials to which they have access. \\nResearchers must also be aware that the university will judge their performance as researchers through their publications or through other scholarly products that arise from their res earch. Research that is restricted in dissemination, or not available for \\npublic review, cannot be considered in promotion or reappointment decisions or in evaluations of ac ademic performance of any kind. \\nConsiderations for Students \\nThere are important con cerns about the involvement of students in restricted research. It \\nis necessary for students to publish their work in order to obtain degrees, course credit \\n84 \\n \\n and professional recognition. Students rely to a large degree on their faculty advisor's \\njudgment f or guidance and advice. Research that is restricted in dissemination, or not \\navailable for public review, cannot be used for academic credit. Thus, before working on such research, a student must be notified in writing that work on this research may not be \\nused for academic credit. \\nRestricted Research in Semi -Autonomous Units \\nThe semi -autonomous units associated with Carnegie Mellon may conduct restricted \\nresearch. \\nFaculty members may conduct restricted research in or in cooperation with semi -\\nautonomous uni ts only on a consulting basis or by means of a formal, internal leave of \\nabsence from their non- autonomous units. \\nWork that is restricted in any way may not be used for academic evaluations until it is released for publication, and then only with respect to future academic actions. \\nStudents may occasionally be employed by the semi- autonomous units, provided that \\nsuch employment does not interfere substantially with progress toward a degree. \\nHowever, they must be made aware that work that is restricted canno t be used for \\nacademic credit. Work that was restricted and is later released for dissemination and review can be applied toward future academic credit. Students should be discouraged \\nfrom working on restricted research in which disseminati on may be delaye d indefinitely. \\nGuidelines for all Units \\nWork by students on restricted research projects shall not be made a condition for \\nadmission or financial aid. \\nThe principal investigator is responsible for informing all members of a project (faculty, staff and stu dents) of any restrictions imposed on the dissemination of information \\nrelated to the research. This must be done prior to the start of the project or prior to an individual joining an existing project. \\nRestrictions on access to university facilities due to the conduct of restricted research must be kept to a minimum. Access to and movement through the facilities in which restricted research is conducted must be consistent with standard university procedures. \\nThe Provost's Office is responsible for obtaining signed documents from principal investigators on restricted research projects attesting that they are aware of all restrictions imposed on the research and that they have informed all participants of these restrictions. \\n85 \\n \\n The Office of Sponsored Re search shall review all proposals and contracts prior to \\napproval for conformity with these guidelines. Any that do not meet these guidelines will \\nbe referred to the University Research Council (URC) for review and recommendation of appropriate action to the provost. \\nTo maintain a balance with the university's goals of broad dissemination of knowledge, the URC will conduct an annual review of all restricted research being conducted at the university. This review will be made based on a listing of all contra cts that involve \\nrestricted research. This listing shall include the title and sponsor(s) of the research, name(s) of principal investigator(s), and the amount of funding of each contract. \\nThe university community will be informed annually, through the URC 's written report to \\nthe Faculty Senate and Student Senate, of the nature and overall impact of restricted research at Carnegie Mellon. \\nExisting sponsored research projects shall be allowed to continue under the terms of their present contract. However, re newal contracts must conform with this policy. \\nRetention of Student Work Policy \\nThe university reserves the right in all colleges to retain indefinitely any student work the \\nfaculty may select. All work not retained by the university must be claimed at the time \\nspecified on the bulletin boards (or other forms of communication) of the department \\nconcerned; otherwise, the work will be destroyed. \\nStatute of Limitations \\u2013 Master\\u2019s Studies \\nStudents will complete all requirements for the master\\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive departm ent, school or college policy. Once this time -to-degree limit has lapsed, the \\nperson may resume work towards a master\\u2019s degree only i f newly admitted to a currently \\noffered master\\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program. \\nUnder extenuating circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a college/s chool may, upon the relevant \\ndepartment's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing the master\\u2019s degree as part -time students for all semesters of their \\nprogram, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit. \\n86 \\n \\n \\nStatute of Limitations \\u2013 Undergraduate Students \\nAll units required for an undergraduate deg ree, whether earned in residence, transferred \\nfrom another institution or granted via advanced placement, must have been earned within \\neight years of the date on which the degree is granted. This statutory period can be extended by the dean of the student's college under the following conditions: \\n\\u2022 the courses taken prior to the statutory period still represent a reasonable part of the \\nstudent's total academic program; \\n\\u2022 the prior courses provide adequate preparation for courses which must still be taken to fulfill the degree requirements; \\n\\u2022 there is a legitimate reason(s) for the student not completing the academic program \\nwithin the statutory period. \\nA request for a waiver of the statute of limitations must be submitted to the dean of the \\nstudent's college. The request for a waiver should address all of the above conditions for an extension. For cases in which a waiver is granted, the waiver covers specific courses and is intended for a specific period during which the program must be completed. \\nStud ent Leaves Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nStudents must sometimes interrupt their studies for a variety of reasons (financial, academic or personal). Students choosing to take a leave of absence must first contact their department advisor to discuss their plans w hile on leave to work out any conditions \\nthat may be necessary for a smooth return to Carnegie Mellon. \\nA student may leave Carnegie Mellon by either withdrawing from the university (this means leaving the university with no intention of returning) or by ta king a leave of \\nabsence (this means leaving the university temporarily, with the firm and stated intention of returning). \\nA Leave of Absence Form must be completed by all students requesting a leave of absence. A Withdrawal Form must be completed by all students who are withdrawing. Notifying instructors or no longer attending classes does not complete the process. Forms are available on The HUB web site\\n. Not completing the leave form results in tuition being \\ncharged to midpoint of the semester or the last date the student attended an academically -related activity such as an exam, tutorial or study group, or the last day a \\nstudent turned in a class assignment. \\n87 \\n \\n Students are required to fill out all information on the form, including all comment \\nsections relating to reasons for their leave of abse nce. After completion of the form, \\nstudents must take it to their home department and dean's office for appropriate signatures. The process of taking a leave will not be complete until all necessary signatures are on the leave form. Under certain circumsta nces, students may also need \\nthe Dean of Student Affairs to sign off on the leave form. International students who are here on a F1 or J1 visa must consult the Office of International Education for information on possible visa implications prior to going o n leave. \\nStudents on leave are not permitted to live in university housing, attend classes or maintain employment as students at Carnegie Mellon while their leave is in effect. \\nDoctoral candidates in ABD (All But Dissertation) status who wish to take a lea ve of \\nabsence should refer to the Doctoral Student Status policy. \\nLeaves during the academic semester will take effect as of the date signed by the student's dean. After the Leave of Absence or Withdrawal Form is received by the \\nUniversity's Registrar's Of fice, it will be reviewed for the appropriate tuition refunds (see \\nEnrollment Services: Tuition and Fees Adjustment Policy) and grade implications. The \\nrecording of student courses and grades for taking a leave in a semester follows the deadlines for semes ter or mini courses, as follows: \\n\\u2022 On or before the university semester course drop deadline: all courses and grades are \\nremoved . \\n\\u2022 After the university semester course drop deadline through the last day of classes: W \\n(withdrawal) grades will be assigned to all classes. (W grades apply to all \\nundergraduate students, and graduate students in the Carnegie Institute of \\nTechnology, the Heinz College, the Mellon College of Science and the Tepper School of \\nBusiness.) \\n\\u2022 After the last day of classes: Permanent grades as signed by the instructor will be \\nrecorded . \\nStudent Parental Accommodation Protocol s \\nProviding holistic student support is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The protocols on this \\npolicy are designed to support the parental needs of students and their famil ies. \\nStudents seeking any of the Parental Accommodations described below must register with \\nthe Office of the Dean of Student Affairs by contacting the office for an appo intment by \\ncalling 412 -268-2075 . \\n88 \\n \\n Students are encouraged to register with the Office of the Dean of Students ninety (90) days \\nin advance of the anticipated arrival of the child as applicable in the individual circumstance. At the time of registering, students will have the opportunity to consult about resources, procedures, funding options and preparation for discussing academic accommodations with \\nthe student\\u2019s academic department. Students should also consult with their academic advisors either before or in conjunction with registering with the Office of the Dean of Students. \\nAccommodations for Gestational Parents \\nThe birth of a child is a significant life event that may require time away from academic pursuits for delivery and recovery from delivery of a newly born child. Students whose anticipated delivery date is during the cou rse of a semester may need to take time away \\nfrom their academic responsibilities. Carnegie Mellon students seeking time away are afforded two options as possible accommodation: \\n\\u2022 Short -Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents \\u2013 A short term absence from \\nacademic responsibilities up to a maximum of six (6) weeks. Short- Term \\nAccommodation may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, where \\na longer absence is medically necessary. Prior to the absence students must work with \\nrelevant univ ersity faculty and staff to adjust their course work, research, teaching and \\nother academic responsibilities during the period of absence. This may include \\nextensions of time to complete assignments, incomplete grades, and/or dropping \\ncourses, shifting res earch responsibilities and adjusting TA assignments. Students who \\ntake a Short -Term Accommodation will remain enrolled. \\n\\u2022 Formal Leave of Absence \\u2013 A formal leave of absence under the Student Leave s Policy . \\nGenerally, the Student Leave Policy permits students to take a leave of absence for a full-\\nsemester, mini -semester, or for the time remaining in the semester during which the \\nleave is taken. Students who take a Formal Leave of Absence drop all remaining courses \\nfor the semester and are unenrolled for the semester. International students must consult with the \\nOffice of International Education before considering this option due to \\nvisa implications . \\nParental Accommodation for Doctoral Students \\nThe university offers a Parental Accommodation for qualifying doctoral student parents to \\ninclude up to four (4) weeks of time away from academic responsibilities with continued \\nstipend support. This accommodation can be utilized within six months of the birth or placement of a child through adoption, foster care or legal guardianship. Gestational \\n89 \\n \\n parents may utilize both the Short -Term Accommodation for Gestational Parents and the \\nparental accommodation. \\nCareful planning and consultation is necessary given the unique contexts and \\nrequirements of each student\\u2019s situation. Students will remain fully enrolled and will receive assistance in navigating the necessary planning and consultation processes. \\nFinancial Assistance for Student Parents \\nCarnegie Mellon als o offers the following options for financial assistance to students who \\nbecome parents while enrolled : \\n\\u2022 Interest Free Loan \\u2013 Any student who becomes a parent is eligible to apply for an \\ninterest- free Parental Loan from the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs. \\n\\u2022 Doctoral Stipend Continuation (Gestational Parents) \\u2013 Doctoral students who are the \\ngestational parent and who receive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are \\neligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) weeks during a Short -\\nTerm Accommodation for Gestational Parents or during a Formal Leave of Absence. \\nContinued academic stipend funding may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of \\neight (8) weeks, if an absence longer than six weeks is medically necessary . \\n\\u2022 Doctoral Stipend Continuation (Non -gestational Parents) \\u2013 Doctoral students who \\nreceive an academic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon and are becoming a parent by \\nadoption, birth, or through guardianship are eligible to continue to receive stipend \\nfunding for up to four (4) weeks during a Short -Term Parental Accommodation. \\nLactation Rooms \\nAs a service to our community members, Carnegie Mellon offers several lactation rooms for \\nthe purpose of expressing milk while on campus. These spaces are open to all CMU \\ncommunity members and their guests.

In order to be considered for return from leave, a student must first obtain an Application for Return form from The HUB or their academic department. This application requires information from the student regarding the intended \\n95 \\n \\n semester of return, current address information and information about their leave. This \\napplication must be submitted to their home department at least one month prior to the \\nbeginning of the semester. \\nUndergraduates may return within their same academic department within two years. After two years, students returning in the same academic department are subject to space constraints and academic performance review. Graduate students must negotiate their return with their home department and must follow their department policy. \\nThe Application for Return requires approval of the student's academic department and dean. If a student's department chooses to deny the student's Application for Return, the student may appeal to their dean. Any constraints governing the student's eligibility to return will be specified directly on the application by the academic department and/or dean's office or the Office of Student Affair s. \\nStudents who have taken courses elsewhere must submit an official transcript and course descriptions with their Application for Return. Transfer credit approval is determined by the \\nacademic department based on course level, performance and appropriaten ess to the \\nstudent's curriculum requirements. Credit transfer is subject to college -specific policy. Failure \\nto submit the necessary documents at the time of return will result in denial of transfer \\ncredit. \\nThe process of returning is not completed until a ll necessary signatures on the Return form \\nare obtained by the student and until all outstanding bills are paid. Enrollment Services will then notify the appropriate university offices of the student's return. \\nStudents\\u2019 Rights Policy \\nThe primary right of s tudents is to pursue their education so long as they maintain their \\neligibility to remain a member of the community by meeting its academic standards and so long as they observe the regulations imposed by the university for the governance of the academic community. \\nThe second right of students is to be recognized as members of the student body, with all the privileges pursuant thereto as to use of physical plant, university services and facilities. \\nEvery student has the constitutional rights and responsibilities of any citizen under the law. Conversely, a responsibility of any student is to respect these rights of any other member of the university community. \\nA student has the right to expect that academic and professional processes should be flexible and pe riodically open to review and to participate constructively with faculty and \\n96 \\n \\n administration in those processes by which the university community maintains the \\nexcellence of the standards of its curriculum and methods of instruction and the viability of its total educational program. \\nThe student has the right to recourse through the procedures outlined in The Word/Student Handbook against unreasonable academic action. \\nStudent Suspension/Required Withdrawal Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nUniversity Suspension is a f orced, temporary leave from the university. There are three \\ntypes of suspension for students that apply to both graduate and undergraduate students: \\nAcademic Suspension is the result of poor academic performance or violation of academic \\nregulations and is imposed by the student's college or academic department (see university and college academic policies). \\nDisciplinary Suspension is the result of serious personal misconduct and is imposed by the \\nOffice of Student Affairs (see The Word: Student Handbook ). \\nAdministrative Suspension is the result of failure to meet university financial obligations or \\nfailure to comply with federal, state or local health regulations and is imposed by Enrollment Services. (See \\nStudent Accounts Receivable Collection Policy and Procedures \\nfor financial obligations. Contact University Health Services for information about health \\nregulations.) \\nSuspended students may not: \\n\\u2022 register for course s \\n\\u2022 attend classes \\n\\u2022 live in student or fraternity/sorority housing \\n\\u2022 use campus facilities, including athletic facilities, library and computer clusters \\n\\u2022 participate in student activities \\n\\u2022 be members of student organizations \\n\\u2022 have student jobs \\n(Note : students on academic suspension may have a summer campus job if they accepted \\nthe job before they were suspended. ) \\n97 \\n \\n Employment \\nAlthough suspended students may not hold student jobs, students on academic \\nsuspension may, under certain circumstances, have a non -student job with the university; \\nstudents on disciplinary or administrative suspension may not. \\nTo have a non- student job, students on academic suspension must receive approval from \\ntheir associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head (graduate students) to \\nensure that the job will not violate their suspension terms. Students in violation of this will lose their degree student status, meaning they would have to reapply for admission to Carnegie Mellon through either Und ergraduate Admission or the appropriate graduate \\ndepartment. \\nTransfer Credit \\nSuspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college's and de partment's policies allow this. \\nAppeals \\nTo appeal any action of this policy, the student may write to the following people: \\nAcademic Suspension - associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head \\n(graduate students); \\nDisciplinary Suspension - dean of student affairs; \\nAdministrative Suspension - vice president for enrollment, vice president for business and \\nplanning, and the dean of student affairs, in consultation wit h the student's associate \\ndean. \\nReturning from Suspension \\nIn order to return from a suspension, a student must have the following approval: \\nAcademic Suspension - associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head \\n(graduate students); \\nDisciplinary Suspension - dean of student affairs; \\nAdministrative Suspension - vice president for campus affairs or designate. \\n98 \\n \\n \\nSummary of Graduate Student A ppeal and Grievance Procedures \\nIntroduction \\nSet forth below is a summary of the processes available to graduate students who seek \\nreview of academic and non -academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected \\nto seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow these formal procedures. To the extent that these processes are set forth in offic ial \\nUniversity policies, links to those statements of policy and more detailed description of processes and procedures are included. Where a graduate student's concerns implicate multiple policies or processes, the University reserves the right to decide w hich process \\nshall apply in order to avoid duplicative and potentially conflicting processes and decisions, or in appropriate circumstances, the order in which multiple reviews may occur. \\nThese appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in a ll graduate programs \\nof the University. Students should refer to the online handbooks (or hard copy handbooks if applicable) for their particular programs for more detailed information about the administration and academic policies of the program. To the extent that these \\npolicies conflict in any way with policies, processes and procedures adopted at the College, Department or Program level, the policies set forth herein shall govern. \\nAppealing Final Grades \\nFinal grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. Th e following circumstances are the unusual \\nexceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is \\nbased on manifest error (e.g. a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade \\nor failure to grade one of the answ ers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who \\nassigned the grade did so in vio lation of a University policy. \\nA graduate student who believes a final grade was assigned pursuant to (a) or (b) above should first present the case informally to the faculty or staff member responsible for the course in which the student believes an inappropriate grade has been awarded. Grade \\nappeals should be initiated as soon as possible but no later than one year after the final course grade was issued. If the student is not satisfied with the resolution at this first \\nstep, the student shall submit a formal, written appeal, with appropriate documentation \\n99 \\n \\n to the head of the department in which the course was offered. The department head (or \\nthe program head if the d epartment head chooses to delegate the decision to him/her) \\nwill issue a written decision on the appeal within 30 days, or as soon thereafter as practical. If the student is not satisfied with the decision of the department head (or program head), the student may submit a formal, written appeal, with appropriate documentation, within seven (7) days to the Dean of the college in which the course is offered. The Dean shall render a decision within 30 days, or as soon thereafter as practical. The decision of the Dean shall be final and not appealable . \\nSummary of Levels of Appeal for Final Grades: \\n\\u2022 Informal discussion with the faculty member \\n\\u2022 Formal written appeal to the department head (or the program head if the department \\nhead chooses to delegate the decision to him/her) \\n\\u2022 Formal written appeal to the Dean \\n\\u2022 Dean issues final non -appealable decision \\nSee, also, Carnegie Mellon University Grading Policies . \\nAppeal of Academic Actions \\nAn \\\"Academic Action\\\" is an action by a program, unit or department based on a graduate \\nstudent's academic performance or failure to satisfy academic program requirements. Examples of Academic Actions include, but are not limited to, academic probation, academic suspens ion, and dismissal/drop. Each college, department, or program may set \\nits own academic requirements and standards for acceptable academic performance. These standards and benchmarks for performance are set forth in the online and/or hard copy handbooks f or individual graduate programs. \\nGraduate students will be notified of an academic action in writing by the applicable department, unit, or program head or director, or designated committee. Graduate students are encouraged to seek informal resolution of any concerns related to academic actions informally within the department, unit or program before filing a formal appeal. \\nGraduate students who wish to appeal an Academic Action must submit a formal, written \\nappeal, with appropriate documentation, to the Dean of the College within seven (7) \\ncalendar days after receipt of written notice of the academic action by the department, \\nunit, or program head or director, or designated committee. The Dean may delegate review of the matter to another individual or committee, including but not limited to one of the Associate Deans, the College Council or a specially constituted grievance committee \\n100 \\n \\n who shall make a recommendation to the Dean. The Dean shall render a decision on the \\nappeal within thirty (30) days or as soon thereafter as practical. \\nGraduate students who wish to appeal the written decision of the Dean must submit a formal written appeal, with appropriate documentation, to the Provost within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of the Dean's decision. A copy of the appeal must also be submitted to the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Education and to the Dean. The Provost may delegate review of the matter to another individual or committee, including but not limited to the Vice Provost for Educa tion who shall make a recommendation to \\nthe Provost. The Provost shall render a decision on the appeal within thirty (30) days or as soon thereafter as practical. Decisions by the Provost are final and not appealable. \\nGenerally, sanctions resulting from an Academic Action (e.g. probation, suspension, or dismissal /drop) take effect immediately, regardless of whether an appeal is filed. In exceptional circumstances, however, the appropriate Dean or the Provost may elect to hold sanctions in abeyance pendin g the resolution of an appeal. \\nSummary of Levels of Appeal for Academic Actions: \\n\\u2022 Seek informal resolution within department, unit, or program \\n\\u2022 Formal written appeal to the Dean \\n\\u2022 Decision rendered by the Dean \\n\\u2022 Formal written appeal to the Provost \\n\\u2022 Provost issues final non- appealable decision \\nAppeal from Academic Disciplinary Actions \\nAcademic Disciplinary Actions are sanctions and outcomes imposed when any student violates the University Policy on Academic integrity\\n including cheating, plagiarism an \\nunauth orized assistance. \\nThe Office of Community Standards and Integrity manages the Academic Disciplinary \\nProcess and provides resources to all students, faculty and staff. The process for appealing an academic integrity violation can be found under the Academic Disciplinary \\nActions Index . \\nCommunity Standards Violation s \\nAs members of the University community, Carnegie Mellon students are expected to respect the rights of all students, faculty and staff and adhere to the policies outlined in \\n101 \\n \\n the Student Handbook contained in The Word , the University Policies website , and any \\napplicable college, department or graduate program handbooks. \\nIf a student has observed a violation of university policy or law, or feels harmed by \\nanother student's misconduct (e.g. affecting his/her welfare, property, safety or security) he/she should file a report with the Dean of Student Affairs and/or University Police as appropriate. \\nThe procedures for adjudicating community standards violations and for appealing the results are available in The Word under Community Standards\\n. \\nFor more information about community standards and disciplinary procedures, please visit the Community Standards website\\n. \\nSummary of Levels of Appeal for Community Standards Violations \\nHarassment \\nCarnegie Mellon is firmly committed to intellectual hon esty, freedom of inquiry and \\nexpression and respect for the dignity of each individual. Acts of harassment or intimidation by a student toward any member of the campus community will not be tolerated. Graduate students with concerns or grievances related to harassment or intimidation by another student should contact the Dean of Student Affairs for resolution. Acts of harassment or intimidation by a student may be referred to the University Committee on Discipline. \\nGraduate Students with concerns or grievances related to alleged harassment or intimidation by a staff member, faculty member or other member of the campus community should contact the Assistant Vice President of Human Resources, People & Organizational Effectiveness at 412 -268- 9685 for resolution. \\nSexual Harassment and Sexual Assault \\nGraduate student grievances or concerns relating to sexual harassment will be handled according to the University's Policy against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault. Any member of the university community, whether faculty member, student, or staff member, who believes she or he has been the victim of sexual harassment and/or sexual assault or is aware of such conduct, is encouraged to make contact with any of the individuals identified in the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) under Section V.B\\n. They will make \\ncertain that your complaint is communicated to the appropria te resource for handling. \\n102 \\n \\n Intellectual Property Disputes \\nDisputes concerning rights to intellectual property must be resolved according to the \\nprocedures set forth in the University's Intellectual Property Policy . \\nResearch Misconduct \\nCarnegie Mellon University is responsible for the integrity of research conducted at the University. As a community of scholars, in which truth and integrity are fundamental, the University has established procedures for the investigation of allegations of misconduct of \\nresearch with due care to protect the rights of those accused, those making the allegations, and the University. The procedures for handling allegations of research misconduct are set forth in the Policy for Handling Alleged Misconduct in Research\\n at \\nCarnegie Mellon University. \\nFor graduate students found responsible for research misconduct, the President of the University may impose specific sanctions up to and includ ing expulsion. The imposition of \\nsanctions is subject to the procedures for approval and/or appeal prescribed for \\ncommunity standards violations\\n. \\nReturn from Leave of Absence \\nGraduate students who wish to return to Carnegie Mellon following a leave of absence \\nmust follow the procedures set forth in the Student Return Policy . \\nGenerally, graduate students must negotiate their return to the University with their home academic department and follow any applicable departmental policies. If a department chooses to deny a student's return from a leave of absence, the student may appeal to the Dean of the College. \\nSuspension/Required Withdrawal \\nA University Suspension is a forced, temporary leave from the university. There are three types of suspension for students that apply to both graduate and undergraduate students: \\n\\u2022 Academic Suspension is the result of poor academic performance or violation of academic regulations and is imposed by the student's college or academic department (see university and college academic policies). \\n\\u2022 Disciplinary Suspension is the result of serious personal misconduct and is imposed by the Dean of Student Affairs (see The Word/Student Handbook\\n). \\n\\u2022 Administrative Suspension is the result of failure to meet university financial \\nobligations or failure to comply with federal, state or local health regulations and is \\n103 \\n \\n imposed by Enrollment Services. (See Student Accounts Receivable Collection Policy \\nand Procedures for fina ncial obligations. Contact Student Health Services for \\ninformation about health regulations.) \\nGraduate students who wish to appeal a suspension or required withdrawal may write to \\nthe following individuals depending on the type of suspension: \\n\\u2022 Academic Suspension \\u2013 The applicable department, unit, or program head \\n\\u2022 Disciplinary Suspension \\u2013 Dean of Student Affairs \\n\\u2022 Administrative Suspension \\u2013Vice President for Enrollment, Vic e President for Business \\nand Planning, and the Dean of Student Affairs, in consultation with the student\\u2019s Associate Dean \\nFor more details see the Student Suspension/Required Withdrawal Policy\\n. \\nGeneral Grievances \\nThe following grievance procedures are to be used for graduate student problems or concerns that are not covered by any of the policies or procedures set forth above. As such, these grievance procedures may no t be used as a substitute for procedures \\ncontemplated under any other policy, including but not limited to, policies regarding academic actions; academic disciplinary actions; community standards; harassment; sexual harassment; intellectual property; resea rch misconduct or any other policy. \\nGraduate students are expected to discuss any concerns or grievances initially with the faculty or staff member(s) involved. Students are strongly encouraged to seek informal resolution of grievances through consultations within the academic unit, department or program. Students may also seek assistance with the informal resolution of a grievance through the Vice Provost for Education. \\nIf a grievance cannot be resolved informally with the faculty or staff member involv ed \\nwithin the academic department, a student may submit a formal, written grievance to the head of the department, unit or program. If there is more than one student with a grievance on a particular matter, each student must submit a separate grievance. The department, unit, or program head, or director or designated committee will issue a written decision on the grievance within thirty (30) days or as soon thereafter as practical. \\nGraduate students who wish to appeal from the decision rendered at the department, unit or program level must submit a formal, written appeal to the Dean of the College within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of written notice of the decision by the department, unit, or program head, or director or designated committee. The Dean may delegate review of the matter to another individual or committee, including but not \\n104 \\n \\n limited to one of the Associate Deans, the College Council or a specially constituted \\ngrievance committee who shall make a recommendation to the Dean.

U.S. Federal Personal Income Tax (and Tax Status) \\na. U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents \\nTo fulfill its legal obligations, the university treats graduate student awards by the university in the form of scholarships, fellowships, teaching assistantships, research assistantships and stipends as being subject to U.S. federal personal income tax a s \\nfollows: \\n105 \\n \\n \\u2022 If a graduate student is not a degree candidate, all award funds are subject to tax . \\n\\u2022 If a graduate student is a degree candidate, the amount of any award used for tuition, \\nfees and required books, supplies and equipment is not subject to tax. Th e amount \\nused for other expenses such as room, board and travel is subject to tax . \\n\\u2022 If a graduate student incurs business and/or travel expenses on the university\\u2019s behalf \\nand submits the expense reimbursement in compliance with the university\\u2019s Business \\nand Travel Expense (BTE) Policy , these expenses are not subject to tax. \\n\\u2022 The part of any award that represents payment for the student's services such as teaching, research or other service (e.g., writing, administrative assistance, etc.) \\nis \\nsubject to tax . \\nIn computing graduate student taxable income for purposes of required tax withholdings \\nand any required informational returns, the university can determine centrally the part of a graduate student's award that covers tuition and required university fees, since the university publishes these costs. If departments submit to the HR Service Center a \\nmonthly award amount in addition to tuition and required fees, the entire additional amount is subject to tax. It is the graduate students\\u2019 responsibility to determine the portion of their award used for any additional required fees an d expenses (e.g., books, \\nsupplies and equipment). \\nThe university excludes the amount of the graduate student's award used for tuition and required university fees from the amount of taxable income shown on the graduate student\\u2019s IRS Form W -2. \\nGraduate students who have questions about the U.S. federal personal income tax consequences of their graduate student awards should consult their own personal tax advisor or refer to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 970, \\\"Tax Benefits for Education.\\\" Non- resident alien graduate students may also wish to review the \\u201cStudents \\nand Apprentices\\u201d section of IRS Publication 901, \\\"U.S. Tax Treaties.\\\" These IRS \\npublications, and more information about U.S. federal income taxes, may be found at \\nwww.irs.gov\\n. \\nb. Foreign Students and Permanent Residents \\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. citizens and permanent residents are considered residents, but foreign graduate students may be considered residents or non-residents for tax purposes. Information on tax residency status may be found in IRS Publication 519, \\u201cU.S. Tax Guide for Aliens.\\u201d Some foreign graduate students may benefit from specific tax treaties between the U.S. and their home countries. I nformation on tax \\n106 \\n \\n treaties is contained in IRS Publication 901, \\u201cU.S. Tax Treaties.\\u201d These IRS publications, and \\nmore information on U.S. federal income taxes, may be found at www.irs.gov . \\nIII. Pennsylvania Personal Income Tax \\nThe following applies only for those graduate students providing services within \\nPennsylvania. Therefore, if the graduate student is providing services at a university \\nlocation in another state as part of the degree requirements that state\\u2019s income tax may be withheld from fellowship or stipend payments. \\nFor purposes of Pennsylvania personal income tax and required withholdings, to fulfill its legal obligations, the university treats fellowship awards and stipends as taxable compensation for services if the recipient is required to apply his skill and training to advance research, creative work, or some other project or activity,\\n unless the recipient is a \\ncandidate for a degree and the same activities are required of al l candidates for that \\ndegree as a condition to receiving the degree . Thus, as long as the services rendered by a \\ngraduate student are a standard part of the degree requirements for all students in the student\\u2019s program, the university will not withhold Pen nsylvania personal income tax from \\nthe student\\u2019s award/stipend. At the university, when graduate students are required to render services, those services are generally required to be rendered as a standard part of the degree requirements for the relevant d egree program; as long as departments \\nconfirm that the services are required to be rendered as a standard part of the degree program, the university will not withhold Pennsylvania personal income tax from fellowship awards or stipends for students performing those services. \\nFurther information about Pennsylvania personal income taxes may be obtained by visiting the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue website\\n. \\nIV. City of Pittsburgh/ Pittsburgh Public School District Earned Income Tax (Wage \\nTax) \\nThe following applies only for those graduate students providing services within \\nPennsylvania. Therefore, if the graduate student is providing services at a university \\nlocation in another state as part of the degree requirements that state\\u2019s income tax may be withheld from fellowship or stipend payments. \\nTo fulfill its legal obligations, the university treats compensation that is subject to the Pennsylvania personal income tax (and required Pennsylvania personal income tax withholdings) as compensation that is subject to the City of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh Public School District\\u2019s local earned inc ome (wage) tax (EIT). Therefore, if an award is not \\nconsidered by the university to be compensation for purposes of the Pennsylvania \\n107 \\n \\n personal income tax, it is not considered compensation for the EIT. As a result, the \\nuniversity does not withhold EIT from graduate students for fellowship awards and stipends that are not subject to Pennsylvania personal income tax withholding. \\nFurther information about the City of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh Public School District EIT may be obtained by visiting the City of Pittsburgh's Department of Finance website\\n. \\nV. Assistance in Responding to Correspondence from Taxing Bodies \\nShould a graduate student receive correspondence from the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue and/or the City of Pittsburgh (on behalf of itself and the Pittsburgh Public School District) erroneously seeking to tax some or all of a fellowship award or stipend that was paid to the student for services rendered in Pennsylvania, and required to be rendered as \\na standard part of the degree requirements for the student\\u2019s degree program, the graduate student's department should contact the HR Service Center to obtain a letter to complete on behalf of the gr aduate student citing the relevant Pennsylvania or EIT, as \\napplicable, exclusion from tax. \\nIf requested, the HR Service Center will provide the tax year and income paid to the department, and the remaining information will be completed by the department be fore \\nproviding it to the graduate student. The letter should be sent by the graduate student to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue and/or the City of Pittsburgh, as the case may \\nbe. \\nTemporary Emergency Closing of the University Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nCarnegie Mellon University has an important commitment to students, employees, \\nparents, sponsors, benefactors and the community. Accordingly, the university will make every attempt to operate normally during severe weather or other emergencies. This includ es holding classes, conducting research programs, and operating facilities and \\nservices. The university will attempt to operate normally unless such operation represents a clear threat to the health and safety of students, staff, faculty and visitors . \\nIn the event of severe weather or other emergencies, the Emergency Preparedness and \\nResponse Team will assess the situation and provide recommendations to university leadership as to whether the university can continue normal operations, if normal operations including in -person classes, meetings, events and student activities should be \\nconducted remotely, or if normal operations should be suspended. In the event it is decided that all normal operations on campus need to be conducted remotely or \\n108 \\n \\n suspended, only the president (or the president's designated representative) has the \\nauthority to modify operations and/or close the university and to specify those persons or \\ngroup of persons who are to refrain from coming to the Pittsburgh campus and/or who are free to leave work or class early. Staff members who provide essential services, such as certain members of Campus Operations (including Emergency Management, Facilities Management and Campus Services, Computing Services and University Police) and Student Affairs (including Dining Services, Housing Services, etc.) may be required to work . \\nStandard Operations \\nUnless the president announces the university is closed or government authorities require a closure, CMU faculty and staff are expected to carry out their work \\nresponsibilities. When the university is in session, faculty members are expected to meet their scheduled classes and other obligations. If a faculty member is unable to meet a scheduled class, they should notify their department head or supervisor and ar range for \\neither a qualified substitute or some other manner to make up the course session and/or coverage of the necessary course material . \\nIf the university is open but an essential staff member is unable to come to campus because of severe weather or ot her emergency, they should notify their supervisor as \\nsoon as possible to make alternative work arrangements . \\nAnnouncement of Closing \\nAs soon as the president or the designee determines that university operations must be modified or closed due to an emerge ncy, announcements will be issued via Carnegie \\nMellon email and the university\\u2019s emergency alert system , as well as posted to the \\nCMU \\nhomepage and the CMU Alert website . Media Relations staff may also inform local media \\norganizations . \\nTransfer Credit Evaluation and Assignment Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nThe Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses, originally dated January 13, 1993, and approved by the Committee on Educational Programs and Student and Faculty Affairs states: \\n\\\"Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross -registration program and through the receipt of transfer credit from \\n109 \\n \\n other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include \\ninformation on such courses as follows: \\nCarnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross -registration \\nprogram will have grades recorded on the tra nscript and be factored into the QPA. All \\nother courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. \\u201d (Note: Susp ended students may take courses elsewhere; \\nhowever, they may receive transfer credit only if their college's and dep artment's policies allow \\nthis.) \\nDefinitions \\nA Carnegie Mellon course is one conducted under Carnegie Mellon University regulations \\nregarding course content and grading and taught by faculty under the supervision of a Carnegie Mellon academic unit. Courses taught b y Carnegie Mellon faculty at a Carnegie \\nMellon campus and/or teaching location qualify. \\nCourses that are part of the regular offeri ngs of other universities do not qualify, unless \\nfaculty at the other universities receive appointments at Carnegie Mellon and handle \\nCarnegie Mellon students under Carnegie Mellon academic regulations. \\nCourses offered for cross -registration are those taken under the PCHE (Pittsburgh Council \\non Higher Education) agreement or under the Qatar Education City agreement. \\nOnly official and final college or university transcripts will be accepted for the awarding of transfer credit. Grade reports, letters and the like are not acceptable. It is the responsibility of the Office of Undergraduate Admission, graduate admissions committees or the University Registrar's Office to verify official transcripts. Official transcr ipts for the \\nawarding of transfer credit will reside in the student's permanent university academic record in the University Registrar's Office. \\nIt is the responsibility of each academic department to review and establish transfer course credit for their degree- seeking students. \\nTransfer Credit Evaluation Procedure \\nIncoming Undergraduate First -Year and Transfer Students \\nExternal applicants applying for transfer to Carnegie Mellon will arrange for submission of: \\n\\u2022 official transcripts to the Office of Undergra duate Admission as part of the admission \\nprocess, \\n110 \\n \\n \\u2022 official, final transcripts to the Office of Undergraduate Admission once they are \\nadmitted and prior to their beginning coursework at Carnegie Mellon. \\nAs part of the admission process, Admission will verif y the official final transcripts, and \\nthen send them to the appropriate academic unit responsible for college/department \\nacceptance decisions. Each unit will be responsible for student's review of transfer credit and the establishment of transfer course cr edit for each individual student. \\nCurrent Students \\nCurrent Carnegie Mellon students taking courses at other accredited institutions (colleges and universities), during either summer semesters or as part of exchange programs or other departmentally approved programs, or while on leave from Carnegie Mellon, must arrange for the submission of official final transcripts to the University Registrar's Office. \\nUpon receipt, the University Registrar's Office will verify these official transcripts and send a copy of the transcript to the appropriate academic unit responsible for that student's \\ncollege/department transfer credit decisions. The official transcript will reside in the student's university academic folder in the University Registrar's Office. Each unit will be responsible for its students' transfer credit review and the establishment of transfer course credit for each individual student. Should a unit receive the official transcript, it must be sent immediately to the University Registrar's Office. \\nIncomin g Graduate Students \\nExternal applicants applying for admission to Carnegie Mellon will arrange for submission of: \\n\\u2022 official transcripts to their graduate admission committee as part of the admission \\nprocess, \\n\\u2022 official, final transcripts to their graduate admission committee once they are admitted and prior to their beginning coursework at Carnegie Mellon. \\nAs part of the admission process, the graduate admission committee will verify the official \\nfinal transcripts and retain these official documents as part o f students' academic record. \\nEach unit will be responsible for students' review of transfer credit and the establishment \\nof transfer course credit for each individual student. \\n111 \\n \\n \\nTuition and Fees Adjustment Policy \\nApplication \\nThis policy applies to withdrawals and leaves of absence by all students (graduate, \\nundergraduate, non- degree) for all semesters (Fall, Spring, S ummer 1, Summer 2, Summer \\nAll). \\nOfficial Date of Withdrawal/Leave of Absence \\nFor students who notify the U niversity of their intent to withdraw or take a leave of \\nabsence, the official date of withdrawal or leave of absence is the earliest of: \\n\\u2022 the date the student began the withdrawal or leave of absence process; \\n\\u2022 the date the student notified his or her home department; \\n\\u2022 the date the student notified the associate dean of his or her college; or \\n\\u2022 the date the student notified the dean of students. \\nFor students who do not notify the U niversity of their intent to withdraw or take a leave of \\nabsence, the official date of withdrawal or leave of absence is: \\n\\u2022 the midpoint of the semester; or \\n\\u2022 the last date the student attended an academically -related activity such as an exam, \\ntutorial or study group, or the last day a student turned in a class assignment. \\nTuition Adjustment \\nStudents who withdraw or t ake a leave of absence before completing 60% of the semester \\nwill be charged tuition based on the number of days completed within the semester. This includes calendar days, class and non -class days, from the first day of classes to the last \\nday of final exams. Breaks which last five days or longer, including the preceding and subsequent weekends, are not counted. Thanksgiving and Spring Break are not counted. There is no tuition adjustment after 60% of the semester is completed. \\nThe tuition adjustment schedule is available on The HUB website\\n. No tuition is charged to \\na student who is administratively withdrawn. \\nNo tu ition is charged to a student who is administratively withdrawn. \\n112 \\n \\n Housing, Meal Plan & Fee Adjustments \\nHousing charges are adjusted daily, beginning on check -in day and ending on the last day \\nof final exams for the semester. Holiday breaks are included. The Winter Break period is \\nnot included . \\nMeal plan charges are adjusted weekly. Dine Express and Campus Express are assessed \\nbased upon actual use . There is no adjustment of the PAT bus fee or Student Activity fee . \\nFinancial Aid Adjustment \\nFederal and institu tional financial aid is adjusted on the same basis as tuition. A student \\nearns 100% of his or her federal or institutional financial aid when 60% of the semester is \\ncompleted. \\nStudent grants and non -federal outside scholarships are adjusted based upon the \\nwithdrawal policy of the agency awarding the funds . \\nUndergraduate Course Meeting Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nNo undergraduate classes, exams, academic, or artistic activities (including: extra help session, rehearsals, ROTC drill, make -up exams, etc.) are scheduled on weekdays between \\n4:50 p.m. and 6:50 p.m. Extra class time beyond those regularly scheduled must take place either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m . \\nUndergraduate Course Meeting Procedure \\nThis policy is not intended to reduce the rigor or vig or of the academic or artistic \\nprograms, but to ensure that students have a period in which they are free to carry on co-curricular activities and athletics. Scheduling classes, exams, or other academic and artistic activities makes it very difficult for t he students to meet these commitments. Since \\nwe are all concerned about the quality of life at the university, this time must be held for the students. \\nIn planning the academic course schedule, the University Registrar's Office will review all courses to e nsure that no academic or artistic courses be scheduled in this period. In \\naddition, any requests to schedule additional or makeup course meetings, review and/or study sessions, teaching assistant office hours, or other course -related meetings, must \\ntake place either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. This includes meetings in all university spaces, not just within University Registrar's Office -controlled classrooms. \\n113 \\n \\n As with any policy, there must be a means of making exceptions. Any academic or artistic \\nactivities which you feel must be scheduled between 4:50 p.m. and 6:50 p.m. must be \\ncleared with the University Registrar. These requests must be in writing either as a memo or through email to CMURegistrar@a ndrew.cmu.edu\\n. All requests must include the course \\nrelationship, intent for the requested meeting, and the reason why the meeting cannot be held either before 4:50 p.m. or after 6:50 p.m. \\nAny further clarification of this policy can be addressed to the Associate Vice President and Director of Enrollment Services . \\nWithdrawal of a Degree\\n Policy \\nThe university reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been granted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic records in support of it had been falsified. In such a case the degree will be withdrawn promptly upon discovery of the falsification . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n114 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAcademic Disciplinary Actions \\n \\n \\n115 \\n \\n \\nAcademic Disciplinary Actions \\nStatute of Limitations ................................ ................................ ................................ ................... 116 \\nImportant Definitions ................................ ................................ ................................ ................... 116 \\nCourse-Level Review, Decision, and Action ................................ ................................ ................. 117 \\nAppeals of Course -Level Action ................................ ................................ ................................ .... 120 \\nSecond -Level Review, Decision, and Action ................................ ................................ ................. 121 \\nMultiple Violation Reports ............................................................................................................. 121 \\nRequests for Additional Outcomes ............................................................................................... 122 \\nAcademic Review Board ................................ ................................ ................................ ............... 123 \\nComposition of the Academic Review Board ............................................................................... 123 \\nConduct of the Academic Review Board ...................................................................................... 124 \\nAppeals of Academic Review Board Decisions ................................ ................................ ............ 128 \\nOutcomes ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ...... 129 \\nWithholding a Degree ................................ ................................ ................................ ................... 131 \\nAcademic Disciplinary Act ions Records Retention and Reporting ................................ .............. 131 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n116 \\n \\n Academic disciplinary actions are outcomes imposed when any student violates the University \\nPolicy on Academic Integrity including cheating, plagiarism and unauthorized assistance . \\nStatute of Limitations \\nThere is no statute of limitations that precludes course instructors from acting on the discovery \\nof alleged violations either during the semester of enrollment in the course in question or after \\nthe course has concluded including after the student(s) has graduated. \\nImportant Definitions \\n\\u2022 Academic Advisor : The individual designated in SIO/S3 as the primary major academic \\nadvisor. The Academic Advisor may be designated by the department to disseminate relevant \\ncorrespondence related to academic disciplinary action within the department according to \\ndepartmental procedure. \\n\\u2022 Academic Disciplinary Action : Academic disciplinary actions are outcomes imposed for \\nviolations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity including cheating, plagiarism , and \\nunauthorized assistance. \\n\\u2022 Academic Integrity Liaison : Each department designates an individual who is trained by the \\nOffice of Community Standards and Integrity to provide guidance to course instructors in \\ncases of alleged violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. Absent a \\ndepartmental designation, the ass ociate dean of the college in which the course is housed is \\nthe default liaison for consultation purposes. \\n\\u2022 Course Failure : A grade of \\u201cR\\u201d as outlined in the University Policy on Grading . \\n\\u2022 Course Instructor : Any person responsible for the instruction or grading of a course at the \\nuniversity as documented in the Schedule of Classes . \\n\\u2022 Department Head : The university faculty or staff member who leads an academic \\ndepartment. In academic disciplinary cases in which the home department is an academic program, the program director is considered to be the department head. \\n\\u2022 Email : The official Carnegie Mellon University email address designated in the university \\ndirectory. \\n117 \\n \\n \\u2022 Moderator : The Student Affairs staff member who facilitates an Academic Review Board \\nhearing. Moderators are appointed and trained by the Office of Community Standards and \\nIntegrity. The hearing runs at their discretion according to process guidelines. \\n\\u2022 Process Advisor : As a st aff member in the Office of Community Standards and Integrity, the \\nProcess Advisor is responsible for the logistics of convening an Academic Review Board. The \\nProcess Advisor schedules the hearing, assembles the hearing board, informs the involved parties of the procedures for the hearing, and manages other administrative tasks. \\n\\u2022 Student : Any person registered for, enrolled in, or auditing any course(s) at Carnegie Mellon \\nUniversity at the time of the alleged violation . An individual is also considered to be a student \\nif they have been accepted for admission to the university but are not currently matriculating. Examples include, but are not limited to, students who are enrolled but not taking classes due to an academic break, medical leave, suspension, or other personal leave; students who \\nwere enrolled at the time of the incident; persons who demonstrate an intent to enroll by \\nregistering for courses; and students participating in study abroad programs. Because there \\nis no statute of limitations for academic integrity violations and proceedings can be \\ncommenced after a student has left the university or graduated, \\u201cstudent\\u201d also includes \\nformer students. \\n\\u2022 Student\\u2019s Home College : The college designated in SIO/S3 as the student\\u2019s department of \\nenrollment . \\n\\u2022 Stude nt\\u2019s Home Department : The department designated in SIO/S3 as the student\\u2019s \\ndepartment of enrollment. \\n\\u2022 Support Person : A person of the student\\u2019s choosing who accompanies the student during the \\nAcademic Review Board hearing. The support person does not participate in the proceedings but may advise the student and/or be present at a hearing. Registered support persons are not permitted to participate as witnesses in the same proceedings. \\nCourse -Level Review, Decision, and Action \\nIncidents of alleged violations of the University\\u2019s Policy on Academic Integrity will be initially \\nreviewed and adjudicated at the course level or the equivalent academic level for projects that \\ninvolve research or creative inquiry. Investigations may be managed by the course instructor(s) \\nor departmental designee. In all cases involving alleged violations of the University Policy on \\nAcademic Integrity , the following procedures apply : \\n118 \\n \\n \\nGathering Information \\n1. Suspected violations should be investigated within a reasonable timeframe, ideally \\nwithin one to two weeks of discovering the alleged violation. \\n2. Instructors should notify the involved student(s) of the alleged violation (s) and provide \\nthe student(s) the opportunity to respond in an in person meeting or by phone or \\nvideoconfe rence as circumstances warrant. \\n3. Course instructors may receive information from other individuals (e.g., students, staff, faculty) who possess direct information related to the alleged violation (s) under review. \\nFor example, someone may have observed the suspected incident or interacted directly \\nwith the involved student(s) before, during, or after the incident in question. \\n4. When discussing alleged violations with the involved student(s) or witnesses, instructors should avoid revealing the identity of other involved parties unless it is necessary in \\norder to determine responsibility . \\n5. If a st udent does not respond to notification of an alleged violation (s) of the University \\nPolicy on Academic Integrity , th e matter may be reviewed in their abs ence by the course \\ninstructor after a reasonable period of time . In these circumstances, the course \\ninstructor may proceed with determination of responsibility and outcome . \\nDetermining Responsibility and Course -Level Action \\n1. The course instructor will decide whether the suspecte d violation(s) occurred based on \\navailable evidence. At this stage, instructors are encouraged to consult with the \\ndepartment\\u2019s designated Academic Integrity Liaison, department/program head, the \\ncollege dean\\u2019s office or the Office of Community Standards a nd Integrity regarding the \\nnature of the suspected violation(s), the nature of the evidence related to the alleged \\nviolation(s), and the range of outcomes under consideration. \\n2. When assessing responsibility for an academic integrity violation, the course in structor \\nshould apply a preponderance of the evidence standard. A preponderance of the \\nevidence means that the course instructor has determined that it is more likely than not that the student has violated the University Policy on Academic Integrity. \\n3. If the course instructor concludes that the student is responsible for the alleged \\nviolation(s), the course instructor should determine an outcome . The most severe \\noutcome that can be assessed at this level of review and action is course failure \\n119 \\n \\n although the instructors and/or department heads may recommend additional \\noutcome s for consideration during second -level review, decision, and action. \\n4. Students who have pending or d ocumented academic disciplinary action may not drop \\nor withdraw from the course in question. In rare circumstances, the course instructor \\nmay provide explicit approv al to drop the course . Students who drop the course without \\nthe proper permission will be m anually re -enrolled in the course and further outcomes \\nmay result. \\n5. Students who have pending or documented academic disciplinary action may not \\nchange a course to P/NP (including the use of a voucher) \\nDocumenting and Reporting the Course -Level Decision \\n1. After determining responsibility and outcome s for a violation(s), the instructor should \\nimmediately and in writing via email notify the involved student(s) of the decision. If found responsible, the rationale for the determination of responsibility should be \\nincluded in that notification . The outcome(s) that the course instructor has assessed \\nshould be noted as well. Students should also be informed of the opportunity to request an appeal and the procedures for doing so. \\n2. All documented violations of the Univer sity Policy on Academic Integrity should be \\nreported to the Office of Community Standards and Integrity upon completion of the \\ninvestigation and student notification. Reports may be submitted using the Academic \\nIntegrity Reporting Form . \\n3. A copy of the email communication to the student should be included with the report. Course instructors are also encouraged to submit all evidence and supporting \\ndocumentation. \\n4. Upon receipt of the violation report, the Office of Community Standards and Integrity will notify the following individuals of the course -level decision and action: \\n\\u2022 Head of the student\\u2019s home department \\n\\u2022 Associate dean of the student\\u2019s home college \\n\\u2022 Academic advisor for the student \\n\\u2022 Head of departm ent in which the course is registered (if different from the student's \\ndepartment) \\n120 \\n \\n \\u2022 Associate dean of the college in which the course is registered (if different from the \\nstudent's coll ege) \\n5. Students will receive official notification that the report has been received from the \\nOffice of Community Standards and Integrity. The notification will include an invitation \\nto meet with a process advisor in the Office of Community Standards to discuss the \\ncase, review the appeal process, and prepare for second- level review (if needed). \\n6. In addition to the above notifications, the Office of Community Standards and Integrity \\nwill be responsible for coordinating all second- level review, decision, and action and \\ndocumenting the violation in the student\\u2019s university conduct record consistent with the university policy on \\nStudent Conduct Records Retention and Reporting . \\nAppeals of Course -Level Action \\nWhen a student has received official notification of course -level action from the Office of \\nCommunity Standards and Integrity, a student has seven calendar days to request an appeal of \\ncourse -level action. All requests for appeal must be submitted in writing via email to the Office of \\nCommunity Standards and Integrity. \\nThe written appeal request must indicate whether the student is appealing the finding of responsibility, the outcome , or both, as well as the basis for the appeal itself. The basis of an \\nappeal will be limited to one or more of the following: \\n\\u2022 A gross error in procedural process that materially affected the outcome; \\n\\u2022 Inconsistency between the available evidence and the finding(s) of responsibility in the \\ncourse -level review; \\n\\u2022 Stated course -level outcome(s) of failure in the course(s) that was not commensurate with \\nthe violation(s) of the University Policy on Academic Integrity\\n for which the student was found \\nresponsible; and \\n\\u2022 New information, which was not reasonably available at the time of the course -level review, \\nmerits re -consideration of the final disposition. \\nThe vice president for student affairs or designee will review the written appeal req uest and \\ndetermine whether, in their judgment, the appeal presents an appealable issue that warrants \\nreview by an Academic Review Board. \\nIn the event of an appeal, outcome s will normally be held in abeyance pending the outcome of \\nthe appeal. \\n121 \\n \\n Should the vi ce president for student affairs or designee determine that sufficient grounds exist \\nfor further review, the Academic Review Board will adjudicate the appeal in a hearing with the \\nparticipation of the course instructor(s) or designee and the involved stude nt, both of whom are \\nrequired to participate in the proceedings. The purpose of the hearing will be to make a recommendation to the vice provost for education or designee as to whether the course instructor\\u2019s initial decision should be upheld, vacated or modified based on a preponderance of the evidence standard. A preponderance of the evidence means that it is more likely than not that student violated the University Policy on Academic Integrity\\n. \\nThe course instructor(s) will be asked to provide all documentation related to the case if not already submitted, including the email to the student documenting the course -level action and \\nsupporting evidence related to the violation, to be considered by the Academic Review Board. Appropriate redaction will be made by the Office of Community Standards and Integrity prior to board member review.\\n \\nSecond -Level Review, Decision, and Action \\nSecond -level review is required in the following circumstances: \\n\\u2022 Cases in which a student has committed more than one violation of the Univers ity Policy on \\nAcademic Integrity that has been reported to the Office of Community Standards and \\nIntegrity. \\n\\u2022 Cases in which a course instructor/student\\u2019s department head or designee requests \\nadditional action b eyond course failure. \\nMultiple Violation Reports \\nSecond -level review is required in all cases in which a student has committed more than one \\nviolation of the University Policy on Academic Integrity that has been reported to the Office of \\nCommunity Standards and Integrity . \\nWhen more than one violation has been reported about a student, the Office of Community Standards and Integrity should notify the head of the student\\u2019s home department. The student\\u2019s department head or designee may recommend appropriate outcomes given \\nmultiple violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity\\n and document that \\nrecommenda tion in writing via email to the student and the Office of Community Standards \\nand Integrity. The departmental recommendation will then be reviewed by an Academic Review Board in a hearing. \\n122 \\n \\n If the student\\u2019s department head or designee declines to recommend an outcome, members \\nof the Academic Review Board will recommend an outcome as part of their review in a \\nhearing. If the student\\u2019s department head or designee declines to recommend an outcome, \\nthe student\\u2019s department head or designee should document that decision in writing via email to the student. \\nThe Academic Review Board will review the departmental re commendation (if advanced) in a \\nhearing in which the involved student will be given the opportunity to participate. The student\\u2019s department head or designee and course instructors will also be given the opportunity to participate in the full review. If they opt not to attend the full hearing, they should be available to participate in the hearing as witnesses. The purpose of the hearing will be to determine whether additional university action beyond the course -level outcomes is \\nwarranted given multiple violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity\\n. \\nIn order for th e Academic Review Board to determine an appropriate outcome, the student\\u2019s \\ndepartment head or designee and course instructors will be asked to provide all \\ndocumentation related to the case if not already submitted, including the email to the student docume nting the course -level action s and supporting evidence related to the \\nviolations, to be considered by the Academic Review Board. Appropriate redaction will be made by the Office of Community Standards and Integrity prior to board member review. \\nRequests for Additional Outcomes \\nSecond -level review is required in all cases in which a course instructor or a student\\u2019s home \\ndepartment requests additiona l action beyond course failure. \\nIn these circumstances, the course instructor/student\\u2019s department head or desi gnee should \\nnotify the student in writing via email that additional outcomes are being requested given the \\nseverity of the policy violation. This notification may occur in the initial course -level action \\nnotification or in a subsequent communication. \\nThe Academic Review Board will adjudicate the request for additional outcomes in a hearing \\nin which both the party who is requesting the action and the involved student will be given \\nthe opportunity to participate . The purpose of the hearing will be to determine whether \\nadditional university action beyond course failure is warranted given the nature of the policy \\nviolation. \\nIn order for the Academic Review Board to determine an appropriate outcome , the course \\ninstructor will be asked to provide all documentation related to the case if not already \\nsubmitted, including the email to the student documenting the course -level action and \\nsupporting evidence related to the violation, to be considered by the Academic Review Board. \\n123 \\n \\n Appropriate redaction will be made by the Office of Community Standards and Integrity prior \\nto board member review. \\nAcademic Review Board \\nThe Academic Review Board has jurisdiction in the following cases: \\n\\u2022 Appeals of a course instructor\\u2019s course -level decision and action. \\n\\u2022 Cases in whi ch a student has committed more than one violation of the University Policy on \\nAcademic Integrity that has been reported to the Office of Community Standards and \\nIntegrity. \\n\\u2022 Cases in which a course instructor/student\\u2019s department head or designee requests \\nadditional action beyond course failure. \\nComposition of the Academic Review Board \\nEach case presented to the Academic Review Board is heard by two student board members \\nand three faculty board members. The board for any case must include at least one member \\nfrom the college(s) represented by the parties. When possible, the board for any case must include at least one student member at the same degree level as the student who is appearing before the board. In addition, a trained moderator presides over the he aring. \\n \\nThe faculty board members will be appointed by the Office of Community Standards and Integrity in consultation with Faculty Senate. The student board members will be appointed by the Office of Community Standards and Integrity in consultation with Undergraduate Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly following a selection process coordinated by the Office of Community Standards and Integrity. All appointees must complete initial and ongoing training in order to be eligible to serve as board members. Once trained, board members may complete up to three years of service, and board members may be reappointed.\\n \\nMembers participating in a given hearing will be selected from a list of eligible individuals based upon availability and disinterestedne ss in the case or parties following review by the \\nstudent who is appearing before the Academic Review Board. The involved course instructor(s), department head or designee, and board members will also have the opportunity to note any potential conflicts of interest. The following circumstances would \\npreclude participation as a board member in a given hearing:\\n \\n124 \\n \\n \\u2022 Individuals with prior substantial knowledge of or interest in the student(s) involved or the \\ncase(s) under review \\n\\u2022 Individuals who may appropriately be a witness in the case(s) \\nConduct of the Academic Review Board \\nThe university attempts to ensure fair, timely and orderly procedures in all academic \\ndisciplinary actions. To provide for this, the university has adopted the following procedural protections. The following is a list of procedures that govern the Academic Review Board process:\\n \\nHearing Preparation and Scheduling \\n1. In advance of the hearing, the members of the Academic Review Board will be \\nprovided a pre -read packet, which may include, among other relevant items: the \\ninitial academic integrity violation report(s); any supporting documentation related to \\nthe violation(s); any departmental recommendations for outcomes (if applicable); and \\na written introduction from the student to the boar d. \\n2. The student may submit a written introduction and up to three written letters of \\nsupport by a date specified by the process advisor. Additional information that is relevant to the review including email correspondence and assignment \\ndocumentation may be submitted by the student. This documentation will be \\nincluded in the pre -read packet at the discretion of the process advisor.\\n \\n3. It is the responsibility of the Office of Community Standards and Integrity to ensure that times set for hearings are reasonable and that necessary accommodations have \\nbeen offered to both the student and course instructor(s) whenever appropriate. In turn, both the student and course instructors(s) will be expected to demonstrate \\ngood -faith efforts in their participation with this process, particularly in relation to the \\nscheduling of the hearing. If a case involves exigent circumstances that prevent the \\nstudent or course instructor(s) from participating in a scheduled hearing, the hearing \\nwill be rescheduled.\\n \\n4. Every effort will be m ade to avoid conflicts with a student\\u2019s class schedule when \\nidentifying a hearing date and time. When circumstances warrant, classroom \\nattendance, except for scheduled examinations, will not be a reasonable excuse for delaying a hearing.\\n \\n125 \\n \\n Hearing Process an d Procedures \\n1. Information provided during an Academic Review Board hearing must be kept \\nconfidential by all parties. The student is provided a full copy of all materials provided \\nto the hearing board for the purpose of preparing for or use during the hearing, \\nconsistent with the privacy rights of those involved. These materials are to be kept confidential and may be shared only with permission from the process advisor. \\nThese documents may not be duplicated nor utilized for any other purpose. All \\nmaterials pr ovided to the student must be returned to the process advisor at the \\nconclusion of the hearing .\\n \\n2. In order to maintain a fair and equitable process, no new materials will be accepted on the day of the hearing, with the exception of (i) oral testimony and (ii) such other \\nevidence as may be necessary to rebut new oral testimony. Evidence offered as \\nrebuttal will be accepted only at the discretion of the moderator.\\n \\n3. Prior to the hearing, the student, course instructor(s), department head or desig nee \\nwho are participating in the review will be asked if they believe that the potential hearing board members are biased for or against them. If a perceived bias is \\nreasonable, replacements will be chosen for the board and the hearing will be \\nrescheduled.\\n \\n4. The student has the right to have one person of their choosing present at the hearing. The student is required to notify the process advisor of their support person of choice at a date specified by the process advisor which will be at least three days \\nin advance. If legal counsel will serve in this capacity, the hearing group may \\ndetermine that it wishes to secure legal advice in connection with the hearing. Legal counsel or any other support person, if present, will not be permitted to participate \\nin the proceedings but may advise the student and/or be present at a hearing. In the \\nevent that one party to a case is accompanied by legal counsel without advance notice, a hearing may be postponed until all parties to the case have had an \\nopportunity to have counsel present. Registered support persons are not permitted to participate as witnesses in the same proceedings.\\n \\n5. Witnesses may be registered for each Academic Review Board hearing by the student, course instructor(s), and department head. Witnesses should be able to \\nprovide direct information related to the case(s) under review by the Academic Review Board, such as direct observation of the incident(s) in question and/or direct interaction with any of the parties before, during or after the incident in ques tion. All \\n126 \\n \\n parties are required to notify the process advisor of their registered witnesses at a \\ndate specified by the process advisor which will be at least three days in advance of \\nthe Academic Review Board hearing. . \\n6. In scheduling a hearing, consideration should be given to allow that witnesses significant to the case being heard are available to the hearing group. If a witness is \\nnot available to be called by the hearing group in person or via telecommunication, they may submit a written statement to the process advisor to be reviewed if the \\nboard requests information from the witness. Except in documented extenuating \\ncircumstances, students are expected to make a good -faith effort to provide \\ninformation to the Academic Review Board when called as a witnes s.\\n \\n7. It is within the discretion of the board to determine whether they wish to hear from suggested witnesses. Witnesses will be questioned one at a time by the hearing \\ngroup and subsequently dismissed. They should be present in the room only when \\nproviding information to the board. \\n \\n8. All proceedings, except the deliberation of the board members, will be recorded. \\nRecordings will be kept in accordance with student conduct records retention \\npractices . \\n9. During the actual hearing, the student has the right to be present during \\npresentation of evidence. \\n10. Students and course instructors who are participating in a hearing will be limited to \\nten minutes for their introduction and five minutes to provide a summary following \\nthe presentation of evidence. \\n11. The majority of the proceeding will consist of questioning from the board members for all parties as well as registered witnesses. Students and course instructors will also have the opportunity to present questions for the board\\u2019s consideration.\\n \\n12. Following each summary, the board will enter closed deliberations . \\n13. In cases that involve appeals of course -level action, no information about the \\nstudent's prior violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity will be shared with the Academic Review Board. If the student has prior violations on record and the course -level action is upheld on appeal, the student may be recalled before the \\nboard to discuss the prior violations and outcomes prior to the Academic Review \\nBoard making a recommendation for appropriate outcomes for the present case .\\n \\n127 \\n \\n Hearing Outcome Determination and Notifications \\n1. A representative of the Office of Community Standards and Integrity will be \\nresponsible for notifying the vice provost for education or designee in writing of the \\nrecommendation of the hearing group . \\n2. The vice provost for education or designee makes the decision in the case, informed \\nby the recommendation of the Academic Review Board. The vice pr ovost for \\neducation or designee may accept, reject or modify the recommendation, or may remand the matter to a new Academic Review Board for review .\\n \\n3. After reviewing the recommendations and rendering a decision, the vice provost for education or designee wi ll notify the student in writing of their decision .\\n \\n4. The Office of Community Standards and Integrity will send a copy of the final \\ndecision letter to the following individuals : \\n\\u2022 Course instructor(s) \\n\\u2022 Head of the student's home department \\n\\u2022 Associate dean of the student's home college \\n\\u2022 Academic advisor for the student \\n\\u2022 Head of department in which the course(s) is housed (if different from the \\nstudent's department) \\n\\u2022 Associate dean of the college in which the course(s) is housed (if different fro m \\nthe student's college) \\n5. Parents of a student will not be notified of any academic disciplinary action, except as \\npermitted by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) . \\n6. Academic disciplinary actions will be recorded in the student's disciplina ry record in \\nthe Office of Community Standards and Integrity in accordance with student conduct \\nrecords retention practices . When academic disciplinary actions affect eligibility for \\nenrollment, designation on other university records will be made. Academic disciplinary records will not be released as a part of the official transcript of the \\nacademic record of a student .\\n \\n128 \\n \\n \\nAppeals of Academic Review Board Decisions \\nA student may appeal a decision delivered by the vice provost for education or designee \\nfollowing the Academic Review Board process by submitting a request for appeal in writing via \\nemail to the provost of the university within seven calendar days of the official notification of \\nthe decision . \\nIn cases in which the Academic Review Board decision pertains to an appeal of course -level \\naction, the course instructor may submit a request for appeal in writing to the provost of the university within seven calendar days of the official notification of the decision. In cases in which the Academic Review Board decision pertains to matters that involve multiple violation reports or requests for additional outcomes, the course instructor and/or student\\u2019s department head or designee may submit a request for appeal in writing to the provost of the university within seven calendar days of the official notification of the decision .\\n \\nThe written appeal request should indicate whether the appeal concerns the finding(s) of responsibility, the outcome(s), or both, as well as the basis for the appeal itself. The basis of an appeal will be limited to one or more of the following cases :\\n \\n\\u2022 A gross error in procedural process that materially affected the outcome; \\n\\u2022 The outcomes imposed during the second -level review were not commensurate with the \\nviolation(s) of the University Policy on Academic Integrity for which the student was found \\nresponsible; \\n\\u2022 Inconsistency between the available evidence and the finding(s) of responsibility in the \\ncourse -level action appeal review or second -level review; \\n\\u2022 New information, which was not reasonably available at the time of the hearing, merits re -\\nconsideration of the final disposition. \\nThe appeal officer designated by the provost will review the written appeal request and \\ndetermine whether, in the judgment of the appeal officer, the appeal presents an appealable \\nissue that warrants review by the appeal officer. In hearing an appeal, the appeal officer, at their \\ndiscretion, may meet with individuals and review information relevant to the basis of the appeal. \\nIn the event of an appeal, outcomes will normally be held in abeyance pending the outcome of \\nthe appeal. \\nAppeals will be decided by the appeal officer in a timely manner as circumstances warrant. While \\nan appeal is under review, the appeal officer will update the student, course instructor, and department head as necessary about the anticipated timeline . \\n129 \\n \\n The appeal officer will require that the dean of the student\\u2019s college review the case and provide \\ninput on the final disposition . \\nThe appeal officer has the authority to accept, vacate or modify the decision as the y deem \\nappropriate for resolution of the matter being appealed. The appeal officer may reconvene the \\ninitial Academic Review Board or remand the matter to a new Academic Review Board for review . \\nOutcomes \\nThe academic disciplinary action outcomes defined below comprise a range of official actions \\nthat may be imposed during second -level review. One or more of these actions may be imposed \\nin response to a given situation. This list is not comprehensive, as other outcomes may be imposed as appropriate . \\nNon- compliance with outcomes may result in further action through the Academic Review Board \\nprocess . \\nThe determination of outcomes will be guided by the following considerations: the interests of the community, the learning and development of the student, the impact of the violation(s), and any mitigating or aggravating circumstances . \\nOutcomes related to student standing \\nThese outcomes clarify the student's standing with the University. Additional violations of the Academic Integrity policy may result in more seve re outcomes including separation from the \\nUniversity. \\n\\u2022 Disciplinary Probation : A student may be placed on disciplinary probation for a \\ndesignated period of time. Probation may entail specific requirements to be met. When a \\nstudent is on disciplinary probation, they may be subject to suspension or expulsion in \\nthe event of further academic disciplinary action . \\n\\u2022 Disciplinary Suspension : A student may be barred from enrollment for a designated \\nperiod of time. Students who have been suspended are required to abse nt themselves \\nfrom the campus (including university housing, fraternity or sorority houses, offices, labs, \\nand libraries) within a maximum of two days after the action and to remain off the \\ncampus for the duration of the time specified as outlined in the University Policy on \\nStudent Suspension/Required Withdrawal. A student on academic disciplinary suspension \\nis not eligible for student employment by the university during the period of suspension. \\n130 \\n \\n \\u2022 Drop from Academic Program : The student is required to sever entirely their connect ion \\nwith the academic program in which they are currently enrolled. Students who have been \\ndropped from an academic program may apply for admission to other academic \\nprograms at the university . \\n\\u2022 Expulsion : The student is required to sever entirely their con nection with the university. \\nStudents who have been expelled are required to absent themselves from the campus (including university housing, fraternity or sorority houses, offices, labs, and libraries) \\nwithin a maximum of two days after the action and to remain off of the campus \\npermanently, unless otherwise specified. Students who have been expelled from the \\nuniversity may not apply for admission to other academic programs at the university .\\n \\n\\u2022 Loss of Privilege : Students may lose specified privileges, which may include access to \\nfacilities, services, and/or the opportunity to participate in university activities . \\nRestorative Outcomes \\nThese outcomes require the student to take action to repair the harm their behavior caused \\nor to utilize university resources to support their continued engagement in the community. Failure to complete these outcomes by the specified deadline may result in additional academic disciplinary action. \\n\\u2022 Behavioral Assessments and Recommendations : The university may require a student to \\nmeet with a health care provider and/or a mental health care provider within a specified \\ntime frame. If so, the student will be expected to fully participate in any relevant \\nassessment requested by the provider and complete any consequent recommendation(s) , \\nsuch as a treatment plan or a referral to another provider. The student is also expected to \\nprovide the appropriate releases to allow the university to confirm compliance with this \\noutcome . \\n\\u2022 Community Service : The university may require uncompensated service (a specified \\nnumber of hours) to the university or an off -campus, non- profit organization as an \\noutcome. The particular assignment of duties must be pre -approved by the process \\nadvisor. Students must provide appropriate documentation verifying their completed \\ncommunity service . \\n\\u2022 Educational/Developmental Assignment : The university may require a student to \\ncomplete a project, assignment, or activity to promote the student\\u2019s education and development. These assignments are determined by the Academic Review Board and \\n131 \\n \\n completion is monitored by the process advisor. Assignments may include but are not \\nlimited to: reflection or research paper, development of a presentation, discussion with an \\nindividual, apology letter, reading assignment, etc. \\nWithholding a Degree \\nBecause a degree from the university signifies not only successful completion of academic \\nrequirements but also compliance with the university\\u2019s standards and good standing as a member of the university community, the dean of students or designee may direct that a degree not be certified by the university registrar and therefore not awarded pending the resolution of academic disciplinary action proceedings, including completion of all outcomes. \\nAcademic Disciplinary Actions Retention and Reporting \\nRecords of academic disciplinary actions proceedings are confidential and are not released \\nwithout the consent of the current/former student or as otherwise required or authorized by law or court order. With the exceptions as noted below, records of academic disciplinary actions proceedings are retained for three years after final separation of the student from the university. For purposes of determining final separation from the university, a student must be separated for three continuous ye ars. If a student reenrolls in any student program within three \\nyears, the calculation of the final separation date will reset. \\nConsistent with the Student Privacy Rights Policy\\n, for purposes of academic disciplinary actions \\nrecord checks, information from these records is only provided, with appropriate authorization as necessary, for three years after final separation from the university (as d efined above) \\nprovided the student has fulfilled all obligations to the university. \\nThe file may be maintained indefinitely and reported longer than three years after the student separates from the university if a student has not fulfilled all obligations or has not resolved a pending Academic Integrity violation. \\nRecords of academic disciplinary actions proceedings resulting in the permanent separation of a \\nstudent from the university (e.g., expulsion) will be maintained and reported indefinitely. \\nCase- specific questions regarding timeframes for academic disciplinary actions records \\nretention and reporting can be directed to the Office of Community Standards & Integrity\\n. \\n \\n \\n132 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCommunity Policies \\n \\n \\n133 \\n \\n

Carnegie Mellon are under the direction of \\nStudent Government, the Division of Student Affairs, or particular university departments, committees and councils advisory to the officers of the university. In general, students are charged with exercising a high level of self -governance related to extracurricular activities \\nand, toward th at end, are encouraged to form organizations that serve their extracurricular \\nneeds and qualify for recognition and/or funding by Student Government. \\n Financial statements of all organizations or committees that collect money, in any manner, from the student body must be available to Student Government if requested. Publication in The Tartan of a statement of the accounts may be required at the option of Student Government . \\nEligibility \\nExtracurricular activities are any campus social, cultural, service or h onorary organization; \\nvarsity, club or intramural athletic team; or any other campus organization recognized by Student Government or by the university whether participation is on the intercollegiate level or within the university. Students who meet the cr iteria outlined in the Student \\nActivities Fee policy will be assessed the Student Activities Fee\\n by Enrollment Services, and \\nwill be eligible to participate in extracurricular activities upon paying the fee. Enrolled students who seek to participate in extracurricular activities but who are not automatically assessed the Student Activities Fee must pay the relevant semester(s) fee prior to participation . \\nActive Medical Assistance Protocol (AMAP) \\nThe university community values the health and safety of its members and supports an \\nenvironment that encourages students to come to the assistance of one another. To that \\nend, the active medical assistance protocol (AMAP) sets forth an expectation that community \\nmembers take responsible action when the health or safety of a student is compromised due \\nto overuse or abuse of alcohol or illicit substances and/or as a result of hazing a ctivity . \\n136 \\n \\n Amnesty from university disciplinary action and University Police action will be granted to the student(s) for whom medical assistance is summoned and for those seeking assistance from emergency services personnel\\n[18] when all of the following conditions apply: \\n1. An individual contacted emergency services personnel based on a reasonable belief that \\nanother individual was in need of immediate medical attention, which had not otherwise \\nbeen sought, to prevent death or serious bodily injury; \\n2. The individual seeking assistance provided their own name to the emergency services \\npersonnel; and \\n3. The individual requesting assistance remained with the individual believed to be in need of medical assistance until emergency services personnel arrived and the need f or the \\nconcerned individual's presence had ended. \\nThose seeking assistance will be assured that the university will likewise not pursue further \\nuniversity action against any individual or organization involved in such an incident when appropriate medical attention is sought. Students who are directly involved in attending to the compromised student until help arrives will also be granted amnesty from university action. Students involved in an incident for which amnesty is granted will be provided appropria te educational or developmental interventions . \\nIn cases where help is indicated but not sought, the most severe disciplinary action will be taken against all students involved. \\nThis protocol extends the university\\u2019s previously established Alcohol Medical Assistance Protocol (1999) and is consistent with the spirit of several Pennsylvania laws that include safe harbor provisions granting immunity from criminal prosecution for seeking medical assistance . \\nRelated Pennsylvania Laws: \\nPennsylvania Alcohol Medica l Safe Harbor \\u2013 18 Pa.C.S. \\u00a7 6308.1 \\n(a) Immunity for the individual seeking medical attention for another. \\u2014 An individual \\nshall not be prosecuted for an offense under section 6308(a) (relating to purchase, \\n \\n18 Emergency services personnel include Carnegie Mellon University Police, CMU Student Emergency Medical Services, and other \\nuniversity staff (i.e. Resident Assistants, Community Advisors and Housefellows) w ho serve in an emergency response capacity. Amnesty \\nmay similarly be granted, per the laws cited in this protocol, when non- university law enforcement agencies and/or emergency medical \\nservices are contacted though the university will generally have no authority in those determinations . \\n \\n137 \\n \\n consumption, possession or transportation of liq uor or malt or brewed beverages) if the \\nindividual can establish all of the following: \\n(1) A law enforcement officer first became aware of the individual\\u2019s violation of section \\n6308(a) because the individual placed a 911 call or contacted campus security, police or \\nemergency services, based on a reasonable belief that another individual was in need of \\nimmediate medical attention to prevent death or serious bodily injury. \\n(2) The individual reasonably believed the individual was the first individual to mak e a \\n911 call or contact campus security, police or emergency services and report that the other individual needed immediate medical attention to prevent death or serious bodily injury. \\n(3) The individual provided the individual\\u2019s own name to the 911 opera tor or equivalent \\ncampus security officer, police or emergency services personnel. \\n(4) The individual remained with the other individual needing medical assistance until a \\ncampus security officer, police or emergency services personnel arrived and the need \\nfor the individual\\u2019s presence ended. \\n(b) Immunity for the individual needing medical attention. \\u2014 An individual needing \\nmedical attention shall be immune under this section from prosecution for an offense \\nunder section 6308(a) if another individual r eported the incident and remained with the \\nindividual needing medical attention and is entitled to immunity under this section. \\n(c) Limitations. \\u2014 The immunity described under this section shall be limited as follows: \\n(1) This section may not bar prosecuting a person for an offense under section 6308(a) if \\na law enforcement officer learns of the offense prior to and independent of the action of seeking or obtaining emergency assistance as described in subsection (a). \\n(2) This section shall not int erfere with or prevent the investigation, arrest, charging or \\nprosecution of an individual for a crime other than an offense under section 6308(a). \\n(3) This section shall not bar the admissibility of evidence in connection with the \\ninvestigation and prose cution for a crime other than an offense under section 6308(a). \\n(4) This section shall not bar the admissibility of evidence in connection with the \\ninvestigation and prosecution of a crime with regard to another defendant who does not independently qualif y for immunity under this section. \\n(d) Good faith immunity. \\u2014 In addition to any other applicable immunity or limitation on \\ncivil liability, a law enforcement officer, campus security officer or prosecuting attorney who, acting in good faith, charges a per son who is thereafter determined to be entitled to \\n138 \\n \\n immunity under this section shall not be subject to civil liability for the filing of the \\ncharges. \\n(e) Definitions. \\u2014 As used in this section, the following words and phrases shall have the \\nmeanings given to them in this subsection unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: \\n\\u2022

The following is a summary of the policy which can be found in its entirety on the Student Government Policies page\\n. \\nPurpose and Scope of Policy \\nCarnegie Mellon University is a community where many different opportunities are available outside the classroom. As a result, groups compete for the use of effective \\nadvertising space on campus. The Student Government Graffiti and Poster Policy helps to regulate the use of advertising space on Carnegie Mellon University's Pittsburgh campus . \\nNoting the Use of Student Activities Fees \\nIf one hundred (100) percent of the budget for a student organization, activity or event is financed by the Activities Fee, then all advertising and printed material associated with that organization, activity or event must inclu de the phrase \\\"Funded by your Student \\nActivities Fee\\\". \\n If the Activities Fee finances a portion of the budget for a student organization, activity or \\nevent, but less than one hundred (100) percent of that budget, then all advertising and \\nprinted material associated with that organization, activity or event must include either the phrase \\\"Funded in part by your Student Activities Fee\\\", or \\\"Funded by your Student Activities Fee\\\" . \\nGraffiti \\nGraffiti is not a permissible form of advertising on Carnegie Mellon U niversity's campus. \\nGraffiti is defined as any defacement of Carnegie Mellon University property, the defacement of posters hung on campus bulletin boards, and/or the use of drawings or messages in a public space that are libelous in nature or violate the Carnegie Mellon Code. Graffiti is distinguished from painting the fence and chalking on Carnegie Mellon University sidewalks. Permissible forms of advertising on Carnegie Mellon University's campus include chalking, painting the fence and distributing posters and banners . \\n143 \\n \\n Chalking \\nChalking is only permitted on sidewalks. Chalking is not permitted in areas that are not \\ndirectly exposed to rainfall, including covered sidewalks and vertical portions of outdoor stairs. Chalking of this sort is a form of graffiti. The sidewalk chalk used for chalking must be water -soluble and must be removable by the natural elements. Products such as spray \\nchalk, washable crayons, and other semi -permanent products deemed not removable by \\nthe natural elements are considered a for m of graffiti . \\nPainting the Fence \\nPainting the Fence, a long standing tradition at Carnegie Mellon University, is not considered graffiti so long as only paintbrushes are used. The use of spray paint, airbrushes, paint rollers, and similar tools to paint the Fence is a form of graffiti. While painting the Fence, all painting materials must be kept within the gravel area surrounding the Fence. Painting anything other than the Fence is a form of graffiti . \\nPosters \\nCarnegie Mellon University recognized groups, organizations, academic and administrative departments, and students are only permitted to post active posters on the Student Government bulletin board. Posters are not permitted on doors, walls, and/or windows at Carnegie Mellon University. Locations of permitted bulletin boards can be found on the Student Government website. Posters must meet the following criteria : \\n\\u2022 The posted items do not exceed a size of 11\\\" x 17\\\"; \\n\\u2022 The name and contact information of the sponsoring Carnegie Mellon University \\nrecognized group, organization, department, or member of the campus community is clearly indicated on the poster, unless that poster has been registered with the Graffiti \\nand Poster Policy Administrator via the Student Senate Campus Life Committee and/or \\nthe Graduate Student Assembly Vice President of Campus Affairs ; \\n\\u2022 There is a maximum of one (1) active poster per event, per bulletin board location; \\n\\u2022 New posters are not posted over other active posters; \\n\\u2022 The posted items are removed from bulletin board locations no more than seven (7) \\ndays after they are no longer active posters. \\nBanners \\nStudent organizations are permitted to hang banners on Doherty Hall through the \\nfollowing procedure : \\n144 \\n \\n \\u2022 All banners must be approved by the Office of Student Activities. \\n\\u2022 Space for large banners that are hung over the entrance to Doherty Hall can be \\nreserved on a first come, first serve basis, through the Office of Student Activities. \\n\\u2022 Banners posted on the outside wall of Doherty Hall must be removed within forty -eight \\n(48) hours aft er the event advertised on the banner. If no event is advertised, the \\nbanner must be removed no later than thirty (30) days after its initial posting on \\nDoherty Hall . \\nEnforcement Summary \\nThis policy should be reviewed in its entirety online . \\nThe Student Government Graffiti and Poster Policy Administrator will monitor Student \\nGovernment bulletin boards and report any violations and/or graffiti to the appropriate parties. Groups or individuals violating this policy will be notified in writing, noting if a fine is being assessed and the process for appealing that fine . \\nAdvertising in the Cohon University Center \\nThose who want their poster to appear on the bulletin board location near the Cohon University Center Information Desk shall submit two posters per event to the Information Desk. This board is maintained by Cohon University Center administration and only posters submitted to the Desk will be displayed; all others will be removed. All other bulletin boards in the Cohon University Center are subject to the regulations set f orth by \\nthe Director of the Cohon University Center . \\nAlcohol and Drug Policy \\nI. Policy Statement \\nCarnegie Mellon University is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy community that supports the academic mission of the institution. In keeping with this commitment, \\nthe university permits the use of alcohol or drugs within its community only in a manner \\nthat is legal, responsible, and consistent with the expectations outlined in this policy. \\nFurther, the university makes available information and resources\\n so that its community \\nmembers are positioned to assist anyone whose personal well -being may be negatively \\nimpacted due to misuse of alcohol or drugs. \\nThis policy applies to all members of the university community, including all faculty, staff and students. This policy also applies to contractors, volunteers and visitors while on \\n145 \\n \\n university property (whether owned or l eased) or while being paid or reimbursed with \\nuniversity funds. This policy focuses on compliance with laws in the United States and the \\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. However, as a global university with operations throughout the world, Carnegie Mellon is equally committed to compliance with all applicable alcohol and drug laws in all jurisdictions in which the university operates. \\nII. Policy on Illegal Drugs \\nThe unlawful manufacture, possession, distribution, sale, or use of drugs is prohibited at the univ ersity. This prohibition applies to the unlawful possession, distribution, sale, or \\nuse of illegal narcotics, prescription drugs, and other illegal drugs. It is a violation of this policy for prescription drugs to be provided to or used by someone other th an the person \\nfor whom they were prescribed. It is also a violation of this policy for prescription drugs to be used in a manner for which they were not prescribed . \\nThe university complies with all applicable federal, state and local laws. The U.S. federal \\nDrug Free Schools and Communities Act of 1989 requires institutions of higher education that receive federal funds to comply with U.S. federal drug laws. Although some state and local governments have legalized the use of various forms of marijuana, feder al law \\ncontinues to prohibit the manufacture, possession, distribution, sale, or use of marijuana. As such, in accordance with U.S. federal law, all forms of marijuana, including prescription \\nmedical marijuana, are prohibited on all university property (wh ether owned or leased) \\nand in connection with all university programs . \\nFaculty, staff, and student- workers are prohibited from being under the influence of any \\ndrugs (including prescription drugs) that cause impairment and impact the ability of \\nemployees t o perform their jobs. University employees with a license to operate \\nspecialized vehicles or equipment (e.g., commercial driver\\u2019s license or pilot\\u2019s license) must follow all applicable rules prohibiting the use of drugs before and/or while operating the \\nvehicle/equipment. \\nIII. Policy on Alcohol \\nThe unlawful manufacture, possession, distribution, sale, or use of alcohol is prohibited at the university . \\nAll members of the university community are expected to comply with applicable laws regarding the possession, consumption, transportation, and distribution of alcohol. Except as set forth below or as otherwise prohibited by applicable departmental- level \\nrules, the lawful consumption of alcoholic beverages on university property (whether \\nowned or leased) and/or in connection with university programs by individuals of legal \\n146 \\n \\n drinking age (21 years or older in United States) is permitted by the university. In these \\ncircumstances, however, the university expects faculty, staff, students, contractors and all other visitors to conduct themselves, both individually and collectively, in a responsible manner and in compliance with this policy . \\nThe consumption of alcohol and/or the possession of open containers of alcohol are prohibited (i) while outdoors on university property, (ii) while inside university facilities in common areas, theaters, galleries, dining facilities, or other spaces that are accessible by the public, (iii) while in classrooms, labs, studios, or other instructional spaces when a course is in session, and (iv) at all on -campus athletic facilities. However, alcohol may be \\nserved and consumed in these locations where permitted under Section IV\\n of this policy \\nconcerning Social Host and Alcohol Event Registration. \\nAll university employees, including faculty, staff, and student- workers, are expected to \\nobserve the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct. Faculty, staff and student -workers who are of legal drinking age who choose to engage in the consumption \\nof alcohol are expected to do so responsibly. Faculty, staff, and student- workers are \\nprohibited from working while intoxicated or impaired. Furthermore, faculty, staff, and student -workers are prohibited from consuming alcohol in a manner that in any way \\nimpairs the performance of job duties, endangers the physical well- being of oneself or \\nothers, or could result in the damage of property (in most circumstances, employees are to refrain from consuming alcohol when performing their normal academic, administrative, technical, or professional duties). University employees with a license to operate specialized vehicles or equipment (e.g., commercial driver\\u2019s license or pilot\\u2019s license, etc.) must follow all applicable rules prohibiting the use of alcohol before and/or while operating the vehicle/equipment. \\nSale of Alcohol \\nIn all cases, Carnegie Mellon complies with the law of the applicable jurisdiction regarding the sale of alcohol. Under Pennsylvania law, a liquor license is required to sell \\nalcohol. The university does not possess a liquor license. As such, alcohol may not be \\ndirectly or indirectly sold in connection w ith any university program or activity in \\nPennsylvania unless the alcohol is sold and/or served by a third -party that possesses a \\nvalid liquor license and, if necessary, an off -premises catering permit. The indirect sale of \\nalcohol includes, but is not limited to, the following : \\n\\u2022 The sale of tickets, entrances fees, or required donations to attend an event where alcohol is served; and \\n147 \\n \\n \\u2022 The use of drink tickets in connection with paid admission to an event where alcohol is \\nserved. \\nIV. Social Host and Alcohol Event Registration \\nA \\u201cUniversity Event with Alcohol\\u201d is a university event where alcohol will be served either \\n(1) on campus, or (2) off -campus where the alcohol is paid for directly, in whole or in part, \\nwith University funds, or where reimbursement, in whole or in part, is made for the purchase of alcohol using University funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following \\nactivities are not University Events with Alcohol for purposes of Social Host and registration requirements (however, the other provi sions of this Alcohol and Drug Policy \\nstill apply) : \\ni. consumption of alcohol by students of legal drinking age in an on -campus private \\nresidence; \\nii. consumption of alcohol in an on- campus private residence that is leased, rented or \\notherwise occupied by an empl oyee of the university, where no students are expected \\nand/or permitted to attend (excluding students who are relatives of the employee) ; \\niii. consumption of alcohol in a Private Office with a door and lock that is occupied by no more than four (4) faculty and/or staff members and where no students are present, and \\niv. any events registered through the process that fraternities and/or sororities are required to use in order to host an event with alcohol . \\nAs detailed in the Social Host & Alcohol Event Registration Procedures [pdf] , a University \\nEvent with Alcohol must be registered with and approved in advance by the Office of the Dean of Students, and at least one Social Host must be designated for the University \\nEvent with Alcohol. These procedures set forth the requirements for University Events with Alcohol, the requirements for Social Hosts, and the types of events exempt from \\nthese requirements . \\nThe Social Host for each University Event with Alcohol is responsible for (1) ensuring that \\nalcohol is served only to individuals who are of legal drinking age (2) ensuring that \\nindividuals who are visibly intoxicated are not served alcoh ol, and (3) oversight of the \\nevent consistent with the Social Host Responsibility Guidelines set forth in the Social Host \\n& Alcohol Event Registration Procedures [pdf] . \\n148 \\n \\n The university will provide a legal defense and/or indemnity to any individual who serves \\nas a Social Host of a University Event with Alcohol, pursuant to the Social Host & Alcohol \\nEvent Registration Procedures [pdf] , and subject to the attached Terms and Conditions for \\nSocial Host Defense and Indemnity [pdf] . \\nThe rights of faculty and Trustees and Officers of the University who serve as Social Hosts are not governed by the \\nTerms and Conditions for Social Host Defense and Indemnity \\n[pdf] . Rather, faculty defense and indemnity rights continue to be governed by Article VIII \\nof the University By -Laws concerning Professional Protection Regarding Faculty Members. \\nDefense and indemnity rights of Trustees and Officers of the University continue to be \\ngoverned by Article IX of the University By -Laws concerning Liability and Indemnification \\nof Trustees and Officers . \\nV. Sanctions & Medical Amnesty \\nFaculty, staff, and students who violate this policy may be subject to disciplinary action up \\nto and including suspension, expulsion, and/or termination of employment. Visitors to the university who violate this policy may be removed from university property and university events. Individuals who violate this policy may also be referred for criminal prosecution, though criminal charges are not a prerequisite for sanctions under this policy. Information regarding the state and federal criminal penalties for violations of drug and alcohol laws, as well as information regarding the health risks associated with the use of drugs and alcohol, is available in the University\\u2019s annual Alcohol and Drug Brochure [pdf]\\n. \\nThe university community values the health and safety of its members and supports an \\nenvironment that encourages students to come to the assistance of one another. As \\nspecified in the Active Medical Assistance Protocol students will be granted amnesty from \\nuniversity disciplinary action and University Police action when assistance from \\nemergency services personnel is appropriately sought for individuals in need of immediate medical attention due to alcohol or drug use. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, similar amnesty from criminal prosecution is also available to individuals pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. \\u00a7 6308.1 and 35 P.S. \\u00a7 780- 113.7. \\nVI. Resources \\nThe university provides the following resources to individuals seeking assistance relating \\nto the abuse of alcohol or drugs . \\n149 \\n \\n \\u2022 Counseling & Psychological Services \\u2014 Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is \\navailable as a resource to students for initial assessment of drug and alcohol use, and \\nreferrals to off campus outpatient and inpatient treatment programs . \\n\\u2022 University Health Services \\u2014 University Health Services (UHS) also provides students \\nwith initial assessment of drug and alcohol use and referrals to CaPS or off -campus \\ntreatment programs, in addition to substance abuse prevention education, through its \\nOffice of Health Promotion. Individual sessions are offered alongside online programs \\nto assist students in assessing their own usage patterns and reducing the risks \\nassocia ted with substance abuse. UHS also facilitates the Collegiate Recovery \\nCommunity at the university to support and connect students and their allies who are \\nchoosing sobriety. Information about appropriate community support groups is available through CaPS and UHS. Some of the support programs available in the \\nPittsburgh area include: Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Al -Anon and \\nthe Adult Children of Alcoholics Network of Greater Pittsburgh . \\n\\u2022 Employee Assistance Program \\u2014 Carnegie Mellon has established an Employee \\nAssistance Program (EAP), sponsored and paid for by the university, to facilitate \\nemployees' efforts to resolve problems that can affect job performance and general \\nwell- being. EAP services include counseling and support relating to substance abuse . \\nBroadcasting \\nAll students who participate in commercial, off -campus television or radio broadcasts, \\nwebcasts or podcasts and use the Carnegie Mellon name should consult with the Media \\nRelations Department. These students should contact Media Relations at 412 -268- 2900 prior \\nto their participation . \\nCode of Business Ethics and Conduct Policy \\nAuthority \\nCarnegie Mellon University has various well -established policies and principles (some of \\nwhich are referenced throughout this Code of Business Ethics and Conduct) which apply \\nto different aspects of the University\\u2019s business and operations. As a result of the recent enactment of various federal regulations, it has become necessary to re -state some of \\nthese various policies and principles into one Code of Business Ethics and Conduct . \\n150 \\n \\n Applicability \\nThis Code applies to individuals who are paid by the University when they are working for \\nthe University, including faculty, staff and students when working for the University. These individu als are referred to in this Code as \\u201cmembers of the University community. \\u201d\\n[19] \\nIntroduction and Purpose \\nThe University\\u2019s mission to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and creative inquiry, teaching, and learning requires all members of the University community to maintain the highest ethical and professional standards in all domains. Accordingly, all members of the University community are expected to honor this Code when working for the University. \\nThis Code reflects the University\\u2019s well -established policies and principles governing the \\nbehavior of all members of the University community when working for the University, and is intended to function as a useful summary of ethical principles and to emphasize the importance of observing these principles. As such, this Code draws on the ethical and behavioral standards set forth in many separate University policies and principles as well as applicable laws. This Code supplements but does not supplant other applicable University policies and principles including, but not limited to, official University Policies, \\nthe Faculty Handbook and the Staff Handbook . \\nCode of Business Ethics and Conduct \\na) Ethical and Professional Conduct. All members of the University community are \\nexpected to observe the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct, and to \\nconduct all business and related professional activities in good faith and with fairness, \\naccuracy, integrity and respect for others. The foregoing includes the requirement for \\nall members of the University community engaged in research activities to engage in \\nthe responsible conduct of research, and prohibits those members from engaging in \\nresearch misconduct, including fabrication, falsification or plagiarism in proposing, \\nperformi ng or reviewing research, or in reporting research results . \\nAll members of the University community are also expected to act with due recognition \\nof their position of trust and loyalty with respect to the University, and its students, \\nresearch sponsors and donors. When in doubt about the propriety of a proposed \\ncourse of action, a member of the University community should seek counsel from \\n \\n19 As required by agreement with the United States Department of Defense, the University's Software Engineering Institute (SEI) \\nhas a separate Code of Business Ethics and Compliance that contains additional requirement for SEI employees. \\n151 \\n \\n colleagues, supervisors or University administrators who can assist in determining the \\nright and appropriate course . \\nExisting University policies and principles on ethical and professional conduct include : \\n\\u2022 Handling Alleged Misconduct in Research Policy \\n\\u2022 Faculty Handbook: Statement on Academic Integrity \\n\\u2022 Staff Handbook, Section II. 1: Employment Policies and Procedures - Our Expectations \\n[pdf] \\n\\u2022 Human Subjects in Research Policy \\n\\u2022 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Guidance \\nb) Respect for Others. The University embraces diversity as a core value and is committed \\nto establishing a campus culture that reflects a fundamental respect for different ways of living, working and learning. The Universit y also is committed to the principle of \\nnon- discrimination, and does not tolerate discrimination or harassment on the basis of \\nrace, color, national origin, sex, handicap, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, age, veteran status, sexual orientation or gender identity . \\nExisting University policies and principles involving respect for others include: \\n\\u2022 Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance Policy \\n\\u2022 Disorderly Conduct Policy \\n\\u2022 Freedom of Expression Policy \\n\\u2022 Sexual Miscond uct Policy (Interim) \\n\\u2022 Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Policy \\n\\u2022 Workplace Threats and Violence Policy \\n\\u2022 Riotous and Disorderly Behavior Policy \\nc) Conflicts of Interest and Commitment. A conflict of interest occurs when a member of \\nthe University community is in a position to influence a decision on policy or purchases \\nwhere he or she might direc tly or indirectly receive financial benefit or give improper \\nadvantage to associates. A conflict of commitment arises when a member of the University community's involvement in outside activities substantially interferes with \\nhis or her commitment to the U niversity. All members of the University community \\nshould use good judgment, professional commitment and ethics to protect themselves \\n152 \\n \\n and the University from potential conflicts of interest or commitment. A member of \\nthe University community with a potenti al conflict must, if the potential conflict \\ninvolves research activities, disclose as and when required by the University's Research Compliance Office, and for other activities, should discuss and document the potential \\nconflict with the member's supervisor or University administrators who can assist in \\ndetermining the right and appropriate course . \\nExisting University policies and principles involving conflicts of interest and \\ncommitment include: \\n\\u2022 Policy on Consulting by Faculty \\n\\u2022 Policy on Special Service Payments for Internal Consulting \\n\\u2022 Policy on Conflict of Interest/Commitment \\n\\u2022 Office of Sponsored Projects - Conflict of Interest \\nd) Compliance with Laws and Regulations. The University is subject to numerous laws \\nand regulations that govern the various activities of the University as an employer, \\ngovernment contractor and institution of higher education. All members of the University community are expected to familiarize themselves with the federal, state \\nand local laws and regulations that apply to their activities and conduct themse lves in \\ncompliance with such laws and regulations. Noncompliance, even when inadvertent, can have severe consequences to the members involved and the University, including civil liability, loss of funding, reputational harm and, in extreme cases, criminal \\nprosecution or sanctions. Questions about the interpretation or applicability of law or \\nregulations should be directed to the University's Office of the General Counsel. \\ne) Compliance with Policies and Procedures. All members of the University community \\nare expected to familiarize themselves with and follow applicable University policies and procedures. As part of this, each member of the University community also is \\nexpected to follow the policies and procedures enacted by the academic or \\nadministrative unit within which the member is working at the University. Questions \\nabout a specific policy or procedure should be directed to the individual or office \\nresponsible for oversight of that policy or procedure.

In the ordinary \\ncourse of its business of education and research, the University enters into various \\nagreements, such as contracts, grants, licenses, gifts, purchase orders and other binding obligations, from federal and non -federal sources. Entering into an agreement \\nby the University, including sponsored research funding, creates a legal obligation on the part of the University to comply with the terms and conditions of that agreement, \\nincluding applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, only individuals who have \\nauthority delegated by an appropriate University official are authorized to enter in to \\nagreements on behalf of the University. \\nAll members of the University community are expected to act in good faith and adhere to all agreements and other binding obligations undertaken by the University.

Therefore, all members of \\nthe University community are expected to ensure that University resources, such as \\nfunds and other property are used appropriately for the benefit of the University and \\nin compliance with applicable laws and regulations and University policies and \\nprocedures. When required by their job responsibilities, members of the University \\ncommunity must record, allocate, document and/or report revenue, expenditures, time, effort and other information in an accurate, complete and timely manner. All \\nentries in University's books and records, including departm ental accounts and \\nindividual expense reporting, must accurately reflect each transaction . \\nExisting University policies and principles involving appropriate use of University resources and accurate financial reporting include: \\n\\u2022 Computing Policy \\n\\u2022 Cost Transfer Policy for Sponsored Programs \\n\\u2022 Intellectual Property Policy \\n\\u2022 Property Management Policies and Procedures \\n\\u2022 Business and Travel Expense Reimbursement Policy \\n\\u2022 Petty Cash Policy \\n\\u2022 Policy for Auxiliary and Recharge Service Centers \\n\\u2022 Policy for Directly C harging Administrative Costs to Sponsored Research \\n\\u2022 Purchasing Policy \\n\\u2022 Responsibilities for Managing Carnegie Mellon University Financial Assets \\n\\u2022 Separation of Individual\\u2019s and Institution\\u2019s Interests \\ni) Reporting Suspected Violations. Each member of the University community has the \\nresponsibility to ask questions, seek guidance and report suspected violations of this \\nCode or any other applicable law or regulation, contractual or other obligation of the \\n155 \\n \\n University or of University policy or procedure. Individuals are encouraged to report \\nsuspected violations through standard management channels, such as to their \\nimmediate supervisor or other appropriate University officials . However, an individual \\nwho for any reason feels uncomfortable reporting a suspected violation through established channels may file an anonymous report through the University's Ethics \\nReporting Hotline: \\nCARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY ETHICS REPORTING HOTLINE \\nTOLL FREE: 844-587-0793 \\nVia the Internet: cmu.ethicspoint.com \\nReports of suspected violations may be made confidentially, and even anonymously, although the more information that is given, the easier it is to investigate the reports. A report of a suspected violation is a service to the University and will not in itself jeopardize \\nemployment with the University. That is, no person who makes a good faith report of a \\nsuspected violation will be reprimanded or retaliated against in any way . \\nj) Consequences of Violations. Violations of this Code or any other applicable law or \\nregulation, contractual or other obligation of the University or University policy or \\nprocedure may carry disciplinary or other consequences, including dismissal . \\nConcessions, Solicitations, Lotteries & Raffles \\nConcessions \\nAny group or individual who wishes to sell merchandise or service of any description on \\nthe campus or in the buildings of the insti tution must present an application in writing to \\nthe dean of students.

All personnel actions including, but not limited to, recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, compensation, benefits, tr ansfer, layoff, return from layoff, education \\ntuition assistance and social and recreational programs are administered in accordance with the university's commitment to non -discrimination . \\n165 \\n \\n Further, the university takes affirmative action to attract qualified candidates for \\nemployment who are minority, female, individuals with disabilities, disabled veterans and veterans of the Vietnam Era; ensures that bona fide job -related and valid requirements \\nare used to evaluate employees for promotion and applicants f or employment; and \\ncomplies with applicable federal, state and local laws, statutes, orders and regulations prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, age, national or ethnic origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, veter an status or non -job-related \\ndisability . \\nReason for the Policy \\nThis EEO/AA policy is a reminder of our commitment to equal opportunity and as an update on current responsibilities . \\nThe university recognizes that its success depends on the development and u se of the full \\nrange of human resources. At the basis of this precept is equal employment opportunity. It is critical that Carnegie Mellon's faculty, staff and student body continue to cultivate and enhance its diversity. Through administration of this and related policies, the university \\nintends to assure that all people are included in the diversity that makes Carnegie Mellon stronger in sustaining world -class distinction . \\nRegulatory Compliance \\nThe university does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in employment by Executive Order 11246, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Educati on Amendments of 1972, and other federal, state \\nand local laws. Consistent with the university's Policy Against Retaliation, employees and applicants are protected from harassment, threats, coercion, intimidation, interference, discrimination, or retaliation for filing a complaint or assisting in an investigation under the above statutes and executive order . \\nThe U.S. Department of Labor, including the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is responsible for the external administration and e nforcement of the \\napplicable federal laws, rules and regulations cited in this policy . \\nAccountability \\nThis policy was developed by Equal Opportunity Services and incorporates suggestions by the president, general counsel, vice president for business and pl anning, assistant vice \\npresident for human resources and director for equal opportunity services . \\n166 \\n \\n Equal employment opportunity and affirmative action must be supported by top \\nmanagement leadership to succeed. The president of the university is the chief officer responsible for oversight of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action program. This responsibility is delegated through the provost, vice presidents, deans and department heads, who support the president in maintaining the importance of EEO/AA as a critical component of university operations . \\nResponsibility \\nThe broad -based efforts of all faculty and staff are key to meeting the university's equal \\nemployment opportunity commitments. At Carnegie Mellon, non -discrimination and \\naffirmative action are everyone's responsibility. \\nIn support of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action and equal employment opportunity \\ncommitments, the Office of Human Resources has been charged with responsibility for coordination of the university's EEO/AA programs, which includes: developing and implementing procedures, policies and programs and bringing new initiatives to the attention of senior administrators; formulating Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action plans and monitoring and reporting results; and handling or ref erring complaints to appropriate \\nuniversity access points. EOS maintains communication with appropriate external organizations in order to remain informed about employment and affirmative action \\nissues. The department also coordinates accommodations for individuals with disabilities, \\nas well as compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Vietnam Era Veterans\\u2019 Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA) . \\nOther individuals and offices carrying specific responsibilities for EEO/AA include : \\nFarnam Jahanian , \\npresident, 412 -268- 2200 Involved in all queries concerning the application of our \\nnon- discrimination policy as it applies to educational \\nprogramming, and works with the university's Faculty \\nReview Committee to resolve complaints regarding the \\napplication of Carnegie Mellon's policies as they apply to \\nfaculty . \\nUniversity \\nOmbudsperson, \\n412- 268- 1018 The ombudsperson hears complaints, clarifies issues and \\nsuggests possible solutions to work -related problems . \\n167 \\n \\n \\nFire Extinguisher & Sprinkler Systems \\nFire extinguishers and full- coverage sprinkler systems are provided in residence halls and \\nother university areas to increase the safety of the occupants. Activating or discharging them \\nfor any reason other than extinguishing a fire is a violation of university regulations and will be subject to disciplinary action . \\nFreedom of Expression Policy \\nNote: In early September, 2017, the university convened a group to review this Policy in light of recent \\nevents on campuses around the country. Pending the outcome of that formal review later this semester, and \\nin order to enhance the environment for free expression at the university and ensure the safety of the community, the university is instituting an interim change to this Policy. Effective immediately, individuals \\nand organizations who are not Carnegie Mellon students, faculty or staff who wish to distribute printed \\nmaterial, offer petitions for signature, make speeches or hold protests or demonst rations outside University \\nbuildings, are required to meet the same standards for outdoor events as are already applied to events \\ninside campus buildings, including the requirements that events must have sponsorship from a member of \\nthe university communit y and must meet registration requirements. These interim changes will assure that \\nevents are planned thoughtfully, with the safety and security of members of our campus community being \\nparamount concerns. Students, faculty, and staff will still enjoy norma l use of outdoor campus spaces \\naccording to university policy. Questions should be directed to Gina Casalegno, Vice President for Student \\nAffairs . \\nPolicy Statement \\nCarnegie Mellon University values the freedoms of speech, thought, expression and \\nassembly - in themselves and as part of our core educational and intellectual mission. If \\nindividuals are to cherish freedom, they must experience it. The very concept of freedom assumes that people usually choose wisely from a range of available ideas and that the range and implications of ideas cannot be fully understood unless we hold vital our rights to know, to express, and to choose. The university must be a place where all ideas may be expressed freely and where no alternative is withheld from consideration. T he only limits \\non these freedoms are those dictated by law and those necessary to protect the rights of other members of the University community and to ensure the normal functioning of the University . \\nRights \\nOn Carnegie Mellon's campus, anyone may distrib ute printed material, offer petitions for \\nsignature, make speeches, and hold protests or demonstrations outside university buildings. All such activities must be peaceful, avoiding acts or credible threats of violence \\n168 \\n \\n and preserving the normal operation of the university. No event shall infringe upon the \\nrights or privileges of anyone not in sympathy with it, and no one will be permitted to \\nharm others, damage or deface property, block access to university buildings or disrupt classes. The enforcement of these conditions will not depend in any way on the message or sponsorship of the act or event. When guests are invited by a recognized campus organization, they may express their ideas not because they have a right to do so, but because members of the campus community have a right to hear, see, and experience \\ndiverse intellectual and creative inquiry. Defending that right is a fundamental obligation of the university. Controversy cannot be permitted to abridge the freedoms of speech, thought, expression or as sembly. They are not matters of convenience, but of necessity. \\nResponsibilities \\nFreedom of expression must be at once fiercely guarded and genuinely embraced. Those who exercise it serve the Carnegie Mellon community by accepting the responsibilities atten dant to free expression. University organizations that sponsor invited guests to \\ncampus are expected to uphold Carnegie Mellon's educational mission by planning carefully to create safe and thoughtful experiences for those involved. Hosts are responsible f or the behavior of their guests and should exercise due care to ensure that \\nall participants abide by relevant university policies . \\nConsiderations for Planning Campus Events \\nConsistent with the rights and responsibilities outlined in the university's polic y on \\nFreedom of Expression, university hosts must follow all applicable policies related to space reservation, use, safety and security, keeping in mind the responsibility to have campus police present for any event with 100 or more persons in attendance . \\nHosts should consider the items below as guidance in planning campus events, recognizing that not all of the items below will apply to all events: \\n1. A public declaration of the event, its purpose, the identification of sponsors and co -\\nsponsors, and contact i nformation for those seeking further information. \\n2. A plan for advertising the event, including advance notice to relevant members of the \\ncommunity who may wish to co- sponsor, protest, or host other events in response to \\nthe planned activity. \\n3. Where appropria te, a clear and detailed contract with outside speakers, artists, or \\nsuppliers of services to ensure continuity of purpose and the ability of the host to reasonably control the event, consistent with the host's intent. \\n169 \\n \\n 4. A plan for access to the event, inclu ding notifying the community of reserved seats, \\nticketing, queuing protocol, or other relevant details or restrictions well in advance of \\nthe activity. \\n5. A provision for security before, during, and after events, managed in coordination with the University P olice. Specifically, non -university security personnel must have \\ntheir allowable duties clearly delineated, in partnership with the University Police, \\nwith their role generally limited to personal security and not space management. \\n6. A plan for participant e ngagement at the event, such as through a question and \\nanswer session, if relevant, with a clear delineation of the planned ground rules for the event set out well in advance. \\n7. A strategy for hosting of additional events, discussions, or town meetings befor e or \\nafter a principal event to help provide a context in which the principal event may be best experienced. \\nThe Office of Student Activities and the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs may assist in, \\nor directly coordinate, some aspects of campus events , such as fostering discussions \\npreceding or following an event, or accommodating an opposing view at an alternative event. It is assumed that the spirit of community, both among people and groups with opposing views, as well as between event sponsors and the Student Activities and Student Affairs staffs, will foster communication and cooperation in the planning of campus events. Whenever possible, Student Affairs will work in concert with University Police to notify occupants of buildings in advance of any potential disruption caused by such events . \\nSecurity Personnel Statement \\nAt times, members of the campus community or their invited guests may have a legitimate basis for being accompanied by independent security personnel. It is incumbent upon the host of such an individual to ensure that the University Police approve in advance the presence and scope of involvement of any such security personnel . \\nHazing \\nStudents have a right to be treated with respect and dignity by and among their peers. Hazing is inconsistent with Carnegie Mellon University\\u2019s values and is strictly prohibited. On \\nOctober 19, 2018, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted the Timothy J. Piazza \\n170 \\n \\n Antihazing Law. Consistent with Pennsylvania law, the university defines hazing as any action \\nor situation on or off campus that intentionally, knowingly or recklessly endangers the mental or physical health or safety of a student or that willfully destroys or removes public or private property for the purpose of initiation or admission to, affiliation with, or as a condition for continued membership in, any organization operating under the sanction of or recognized by the university. Any such activi ty shall be presumed to be forced regardless of the individual\\u2019s \\nwillingness to participate . \\nStudents and/or recognized student organizations accused of violating this hazing policy or violating Pennsylvania criminal hazing laws (shared below) will be subject to investigation and review through the university community standards process, which could result in disciplinary action up to and including suspension or expulsion from the university for students and loss of recognition for student organizations . \\nClick here for more information about hazing prevention and response.\\n \\nSafe Harbor for Individuals Seeking Medical Attention Resulting from Hazing Activities \\nConsistent with the active medical assistance protocol expectations, an individual shall \\nreceive immunity from the university\\u2019s community standards process for allegations \\nstemming from vio lations of this policy if all of the following apply: \\n1. The university first became aware of the individual's alleged violation of this hazing \\npolicy because the individual called or contacted university police or student \\nemergency medical services, based on a reasonable belief that another individual was in need of immediate medical attention, that had otherwise not yet been sought, \\nto prevent death or serious bodily injury. \\n2. The individual provided their own name to the university dispatch operator o r \\nequivalent security officer, police or emergency services personnel. \\n3. The individual requesting assistance remained with the individual believed to be in \\nneed of medical assistance until security, police or emergency services personnel \\narrived and the need for the concerned individual's presence had ended. \\nSimilar immunity from criminal prosecution for hazing offenses under Pennsylvania law is described under \\n18 Pa C.S.A. \\u00a7 2210. \\n171 \\n \\n Pennsylvania Definitions of Hazing Offenses: \\nHazing (18 Pa C.S.A. 2802) \\nA person commits the offense of hazing if the person intentionally, knowingly or \\nrecklessly, for the purpose of initiating, admitting or affiliating a minor or student into or with an organization, or for the purpose of continuing or enhancing a minor or stu dent's \\nmembership or status in an organization, causes, coerces or forces a minor or student to do any of the following: \\n1. Violate Federal or State criminal law. \\n2. Consume any food, liquid, alcoholic liquid, drug or other substance which subjects \\nthe minor or student to a risk of emotional or physical harm. \\n3. Endure brutality of a physical nature, including whipping, beating, branding, calisthenics or exposure to the elements. \\n4.

Courtesy hours exist at all other times, \\nduring which the right of residents to live in an environment free from bothersome noise should be respected. \\n\\\"Quiet\\\" is defined as being unable to hear any noise at a distance of 10 feet from a room with a closed door. During \\\"courtesy\\\" hours, noise can be considered bothersome if it can \\nbe heard at a distance of 50 feet. \\nThe notion of \\\"courtesy\\\" more broadly involves structuring your activities so that other people in your living unit are not adversely affected by noise. In particular, all residents are encouraged to carefully pla n their use of sound equipment (such as stereos and TVs) \\nor their social gatherings so that the noise produced by them does not infringe upon the rights of others . \\nThe established quiet hours stated above are the minimums for every residential area. If you or anyone in your living unit believes that quiet hours should be extended, contact \\nyour Resident Assistant (RA) or Student Dormitory Council representative. That person \\nhas the authority to conduct a vote of the people living in your area and, pending unanimous approval, extended quiet hours will be implemented. \\nIf you have concerns in relation to quiet hours or courtesy hours in your living area, please feel free to consult your RA. The RA is your primary advocate in situations involving noise \\nviolations and can assist you by addressing any questions or concerns you may have . \\nQuiet Living Areas \\nWelch and designated first- year housing areas offer quiet living, a particularly desirable \\nalternative to traditional on -campus housing for undergraduate students. This \\ndesignation provides an assurance to all residents in these buildings, and to all residents in the surrounding area, that resident students will act with the highest degree of common courtesy and respect for others in maintaining a particularly quiet and unobtrusive environment . \\nThis designation includes a provision for an extension of the university\\u2019s current quiet hours policy to 24 hours. As such, residents will be responsible for ensuring that the noise generated within their apartments or residen ce hall room is not audible at a distance of \\nten feet from their apartment or residence hall room. Common courtesy will be expected; residents should respond to any request from a fellow resident to reduce the noise level from their apartment or residence hall room, even if already within this guideline . \\nThe following specific guidelines will also exist: \\n \\n185 \\n \\n \\u2022 Stereos, televisions and radios will be permitted but must be used only in accordance \\nwith the general policy. \\n\\u2022 Use of musical instruments will not be permitted. \\n\\u2022 Social events and private gatherings will be permitted; however, they must be very \\nsmall and are subject to the above standards. \\nIt is hoped that this designation of a quiet living area will allow students choosing this area \\nto maintain a residen tial environment which will enhance the academic atmosphere and \\nsupport the important goal of maintaining these special living environments offered on -\\ncampus. \\nRefrigerators \\nResidents may bring their own mini -refrigerators to campus as long as they are smal ler \\nthan 4.3 cubic feet and operate on 110/120 VAC. Residents who do not remove personal mini -refrigerators upon checking out will have their student accounts charged $40 per \\nhour for removal and $160 for refrigerator disposal/recycling. Refrigerators are limited to one per student. \\nRight to Housing Privileges \\nIn signing a Housing License Agreement, each resident agrees to abide by whatever regulations may be established by the university, Housing Services, the Residential Life staff, the Student Dormitory Council or the individual living units. Any resident student whose conduct does not meet the standards established for the university community may be denied the privilege of campus residency . \\nRoom Condition Responsibility \\nAll residents of a room or apartm ent are equally responsible for the accommodation and \\nits furnishings. At the end of each academic year, any damages to a student's room will be charged to the occupants of that room . \\nRoom Alterations \\nStudents are not permitted to make permanent alterations to the furniture or structure of rooms or other residential areas. Prohibited actions include (but are not limited to) painting, drilling or nailing into the walls, and construction or renovations.

Students who make alterations to their room without authorization will be charged the cost of having the room professionall y repaired. All \\n186 \\n \\n decorations should be hung using removable temporary adhesives such as Command \\nstrips or painters tape and any additions to the room must be free standing and not blocking exits . \\nSecurity Camera Policy \\nHousing Services is committed to safety, security and our residential community's quality of life.

The \\nsecurity cameras are not monitored live unless deemed necessary by CMU Police and recordings obtained with the use of the cameras will be exclusively accessed by CMU Police for safety and law enforcement purposes . \\nRecorded images will be stored for 30 days and will be erased unless retained as part of a criminal investigation, court procedure, or other necessary safety practice. \\nA list of camera locations may be available by written request to the Director of Housing \\nServices or his/her designee. \\nSmoking \\nAll residential areas within the university housing system including Fairfax Apartments and Webster Hall are smoke -free living environments. This policy prohibits the smoking of \\ntobacco or any other substance in residential areas. In accordance with Housing Services policies, residents must also abide by policies prohibiting the use of any open flame for any reason, including but not limited to the burning of candles, incense, etc. This designation not only includes the actual residents of the area, but also extends to their \\nguests. As such residents will be responsible for ensuring that any violation of this policy \\nwill be reported to the proper authorities and any violations of this policy will be appropriately enforced. The Smoke -free Living Policy was developed through the efforts \\nof students, faculty and staff to assist residents and their guests to maintain a residential environment, which minimizes their exposure to second hand smoke and its impact on the health of others . \\nSolicitation and Sales \\nUnauthorized sales and/or solicitation are expressly prohibited in any residence area. \\\"Solicitation\\\" is defined to mean any effort to ask for donations or contributions of money, goods or servic es. \\\"Sales\\\" are defined to mean any activity of offering a product or service \\nin exchange for money, goods or other services. In exceptional cases, an individual or group seeking permission to be in the residential areas for the purpose of soliciting or \\n187 \\n \\n selling must receive written authorization from the Director of Housing Services or his/her \\ndesignee. In most cases, those recognized groups or individuals that receive permission to \\nbe in the residence halls will be restricted to tables reserved for such pu rposes in public \\nareas or lobbies . \\nSwimming Pools and Hot Tubs \\nSwimming pools, hot tubs, and any other item containing large amounts of water are prohibited because of the hazards associated with drowning, electrocution, water damage and the weight of lar ge volumes of water. Because we cannot guarantee that all necessary \\nsafety precautions will be taken, students are not permitted to have or use items such as \\nswimming pools, hot tubs, dunk tanks, or slip n slides in or around residential buildings. \\nReducin g the size of the pool or tank does not remove the hazard . \\nUniversity Furniture \\nUnwanted room furniture cannot be stored during the academic year.

Such inspections will normally be conducted according to announced schedules, but the university reserves the rig ht to enter the space without prior \\nannouncement. The university may authorize entrance to an accommodation if convinced that a clear and present danger or a violation of the university's regulations requires such entrance. (This regulation applies to campus housing as well as other university space) . \\n190 \\n \\n \\nMissing Student Protocol and Confidential Contact \\nIn accordance with the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (20 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1092(j)), \\nCarnegie Mellon has adopted this Missing Student Notification Protocol. Each student has the option to register a Confidential Contact person who will be notified by Carnegie Mellon if the student is determined to be missing . \\nConfidential Contact information will be kept confidential and will only be accessible by authorized p ersonnel in furtherance of a missing person investigation. Students who wish to \\nregister a Confidential Contact for notification through the missing student protocol may do so by logging into Student Information Online (SIO) on The HUB website\\n and updating their \\n\\u201cManage Family & Friends\\u201d information under the \\u201cMy Info\\u201d tab . \\nMissing Student Procedures \\nAny community member may contact the University Police or Office of the Dean of \\nStudent Affairs to report concern that a student may be missing. If the report did not \\noriginate through University Police, the information will be immediately conveyed to University Police to begin an investigation . \\nIf the University Police investigation determines that the student is missing, the university will notify the student's Confidential Contact no later than 24 hours after the determination that the student is missing. If the missing student is under the age of 18 and not emancipated, the university will contact a custodial parent or guardian, in addition to the Confidential Contact. The university will also notify the appropriate local law enforcement agency within 24 hours of the determination that the student is missing . \\nIn addition to notifying the Confidential Contact, the University is required to notify a custodial parent or guardian of the missing status of any student under the age of 18, and not emancipated. \\nNo Contact Agreements/No Contact Orders \\nCarnegie Mellon is committed to providing support and resources to any student who may be the recipient of persistent unwanted or harassing contact by another student. In certain \\ncircumstances, it may become necessary for the university to formalize an arrangement \\nbetween two students to no longer have contact with each other (direct or indirect) other than that which is necessary for either party to continue their academic pursuits. Such an arrangement is designed as a protective measure to help mitigate the potential for future problematic interactions between the two students. The arrangement may take the form of \\neither a No Contact Agreement or No Contact Order, as follows : \\n191 \\n \\n A No Contact Agreement (NCA) is a mutual agreement between two students who voluntarily \\naffirm that they will not have direct contact with each other, or make indirect contact through \\nthird parties, except for that which is necessary for their academic pursuits. An NCA does not constitute a finding of responsibility for violating university policy, nor does it preclude the possibility of future review of any past interactions through the community standards process. Following discussion and agreement to enter into the NCA, the two students will receive a letter confirming the terms of the agreement. In the event that a student declines to enter into a requested NCA, an associate vice president of student affairs may elect to review the matter to determine whether a No Contact Order is warranted. Please see \\na sample No \\nContact Agreement (pdf) . \\nA No Contact Order (NCO) is a directive from an associate vice president of student affairs \\nindicating that two students may not have direct contact with each other, or make indirect contact through third parties, except for that which is necessary for their academic pursuits. An NCO may be issued : \\n\\u2022 when, upon careful review , the associate vice president deems there is sufficient \\ninformation presented that doing so will safeguard students\\u2019 abilities to pursue their \\neducation in an environment free from unwanted contact. In such an instance, the NCO \\ndoes not constitute a findi ng of responsibility for violating university policy, nor does it \\npreclude the possibility of future review of any past interactions through the community \\nstandards process; or \\n\\u2022 in connection with the community standards process, either as an interim measur e during \\nthe pendency of the process and/or an outcome associated with a finding of responsibility \\nfrom the process . \\nNo Contact Orders issued after a finding of responsibility are most often binding only on the \\nresponding party. However, in limited circum stances, they may be mutual. Carnegie Mellon \\nwill carefully consider the individual circumstances of the situation, including the burden placed on the reporting party by issuing a mutual No Contact Order . \\nPlease see a sample No Contact Order (pdf)\\n. A student who receives an NCO may appeal the \\ndecision in writing to the dean of students (a NCO received as a sanction through the community standards process may be appealed via the appeal procedures set forth in the Community Standards section of The Word) . \\nOnce implemented, any violation of an NCA or an NCO will be vigorously pursued as an alleged violation of community standards through the community standards process. An NCA or NCO remains in effect until it has been terminated, in writing, by the Office of the Dean of \\n192 \\n \\n Student Affairs following a determination that the arrangement is no longer warranted or \\nnecessary . \\nA student considering request of an NCA or NCO may discuss the situation with a \\nHousefellow, a College Liaison, the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, the Office for \\nInstitutional Equity and Title IX, the Office of Community Standards & Integrity, the Office of Residential Education, or University Police . \\nNoise \\nMembers of the university community have a right to work, study, practice and live in an environment free from disruptive noise. Acknowledging our desire to foster a vibrant campus culture, which will necessarily involve some noise associated with campus activities, the following expectations are intended to guide thoughtful planning and decision -making by \\nstudents and studen t groups : \\nActivity occurring on Carnegie Mellon- owned or managed property that disrupts the normal \\ncourse of business or is otherwise disruptive to the university or surrounding communities is restricted during the following hours : \\n\\u2022 Monday - Thu rsday: befor e 4:40 p.m. and after 6:5 0 p.m. \\n\\u2022 Friday: before 4:40 p.m. and after 10:00 p.m. \\n\\u2022 Saturday and Sunday: before 7:00 a.m. and after 10:00 p.m. \\nTo fully support our vision for campus life, it is necessarily the case that some organized activities will merit consideration for exception to these articulated hours. Such requests are encouraged and should be submitted via this form\\n to the Director of Student Leadership, \\nInvolvement, and Civic Enga gement for review and approval. \\nAny time that excessive noise results in a reasonable complaint from individuals within or beyond the campus, the responsible party is expected to reduce the volume immediately. Failure to meet such a request from a university official will be referred for disciplinary review, separate and apart from any citations or other actions that may be taken by law enforcement authorities . \\nAny individual who would like to make a complaint about excessive noise is encouraged to immediately direct it to University Police, (412) 268 -2323, who will maintain a record of the \\ncomplaint in connection with their response . \\n193 \\n \\n \\nOn-Campus Emergencies \\nUniversity Police Emerg ency Phone Number: (412) 268-2323 \\nIf You Discover a Fire \\n1. If you can, quickly put out the fire using a proper fire extinguisher. Report the \\nincident promptly to University Police at ( 412) 268- 2323. \\n2. If you see that a fire cannot be quickly extinguished, activate the nearest fire alarm \\nstation and evacuate the area. \\nBasic Evacuation Instructions \\n1. Whenever an alarm sounds, evacuate immediately. If you can safely close all \\nwindows in your area before leaving, do so. \\n2. Close your door as you leave, making certain that you have your keys with you (heavy \\nconcentrations of smoke may make your return necessary). In dormitory buildings at night, turn the room lights on as you leave to signal your evacuation. \\n3. Help retard the spread of smoke and flames by closing fire doors behind you as you pass through the building. Fire doors should never be obstructed or blocked open. \\n4. Move quickly to the nearest building exit, but refrain from running. \\n5. Do not attempt to use elevators for eva cuation purposes. \\n6. If you encounter heavy smoke, change your exit route to the next available exit. Help \\nguide others if you appear to be more familiar with the building. \\n7. As you exit, move well away from the building exterior to assure your safety and to \\nprovide ample room for responding firefighters and emergency equipment. \\nNo one is to re -enter an evacuated building until it has been determined safe to do so by \\nthe ranking fire department officer at the scene. \\nAid to the Physically Challenged \\nBlind and mobile persons should first be moved out of the rush of traffic, and then \\npromptly assisted to the nearest exit. Deaf and mobile persons may be unaware of the need to evacuate, and should be calmly advised and guided to the nearest available exit. \\n194 \\n \\n Immobilized persons \\nTo reduce the risk of personal injury, attempts to carry immobilized persons are \\ndiscouraged. Wherever stairs are a part of the evacuation route, the following procedures are to be applied: \\n1. As soon as a fire alarm sounds, the physically impaired person is to be quickly moved \\nto reasonable safety, preferably to an enclosed room or space that smoke or flames \\ncannot easily enter. This action needs to be accompanied by a verbal explanation so \\nthat the person being assisted understands what is happening and why these actions \\nare being taken. Again, elevators cannot be used safely for evacuation purposes. \\n2. If a telephone is available, University Police (412 -268- 2323) should immediately be \\ncontacted and advised of the individual's name and location within the building and the phone number from which the call is being made. If alone, the disabled person \\nmay wish to remain on the phone with University Police. \\n3. If available, a companion, or other responsible person may stand by to remain with \\nand assi st the physically challenged individual. \\n4. Upon clearing the building, a floor marshal or other designated person from the same floor area should alert responding firefighters and/or University Police to the \\nexact location of the person or persons. If it becomes necessary for removal from the \\nbuilding, this can then be carried out by trained, equipped, emergency personnel. \\nAdditional information can be found on the Environmental Health & Safety website . \\nCMU Alert Emergency Notification Service \\nCMU -Alert is Carnegie Mellon's emergency notification service, which sends voice and/or \\ntext messages to your registered phone in the event of a campus emergency. \\nAll students are pre -registered f or CMU -Alert. Faculty and staff are encouraged to register \\nfor the service (login required) if they have not already done so. You can register by \\nclicking on the link in the box to the right. \\nYour contact information will be treated confidentially. You will be contacted by the CMU -\\nAlert service only if there is an incident/event that threatens public safety or during tests of the system in the spring and fall semesters . \\nNote that the text and voice options may carry a nominal fee for recipients, depending on your mobile phone carrier and mobile phone plan. Questions or concerns about the service can be emailed\\n. \\n195 \\n \\n More information on registering for CMU -Alert is available on this CMU -Alert Emergency \\nNotification System website . \\nPersonal Wheeled Vehicle Transportation Policy \\nDefinitions \\nPersonal Wheeled Vehicles: Refers to vehicles used for personal transportation, human-\\npowered or powered by an electric or other non- internal combustion motor. Bicycles are \\nthe prime example. Personal wheeled vehicles also include skateboards, in -line skates, \\nscooters, electric bic ycles, Segways, and other vehicles. For the purposes of this Policy, this \\ndefinition does not include any vehicles which require a Pennsylvania driver\\u2019s license to \\noperate, such as gasoline -powered scooters and two- wheeled, seated vehicles which fall \\noutsi de the PennDOT definition of a \\u201cpedalcycle\\u201d. (See Pennsylvania Consolidated \\nStatutes, Title 75, \\u00a7 102. at Definitions .) \\nOperation \\n\\u2022 In any circumstances, anyone using a wheeled vehicle of any type must yield the right of way to pedestrians. \\no Walk or carry your vehicle when campus traffic is congested. \\no Pass with caution on the left and alert the people around you before doing so. \\n\\u2022 Operators are required to operate at speeds that are prudent and reasonable under existing conditions. Speed limit of five (5) miles per hour shall be observed while on shared paths with pedestrian traffic. \\n\\u2022 No p erson is allowed to operate any wheeled vehicle: \\no Inside any building; \\no On any pedestrian building access ramp; \\no On, across or through landscaped or grass areas. \\n\\u2022 The university strongly encourages bicycle and other wheeled vehicle operators to wear a U.S. Con sumer Product Safety Commission approved helmet or equivalent \\nprotective device. \\n\\u2022 Operators traveling in a manner that is deemed unsafe by a University Police Officer may be issued the appropriate citation. \\n\\u2022 Any type of wheeled vehicle that requires a driver\\u2019s license is prohibited from operation on shared -use paths on campus. These vehicles are only authorized for use \\non public streets and are subject to the regulations of the City of Pittsburgh and of the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code. \\n196 \\n \\n Registration \\nThe university's Transportation Services department allows you to register your bicycle or \\nother personal wheeled vehicle. T here is no fee for registering. Registering can greatly \\nhelp in retrieving a bicycle or other vehicle in case of theft. It also allows the university to \\ncontact the owner for retrieval if the vehicle is parked improperly or abandoned. \\nParking \\nA personal wheeled vehicle is parked/stored on campus at the risk of its owner. For operators' convenience, bicycle racks are provided at various campus locations. These \\nracks are appropriate for bicycles and other two -wheeled vehicles. Information \\nabout using bicycles and wheeled vehicles on campus , including a list of rack locations, \\ncan be found on the Transportation Services website.

When accessing an indoor parking area (i.e. designated indoor parking rooms, personal offices, etc.), vehicle owners should \\nuse the most direct path to avoid impedance of indoor pedestrian traffic . \\nRemoval and Impoundment of Wheeled Vehicles \\nAny University Police Officer, Transport ation officer, or official authorized by the university \\nmay remove and impound any wheeled vehicle which: \\n\\u2022 Is parked in violation of any of the sections of this policy; \\n\\u2022 Appears to have been abandoned as evidenced by signs of disuse or neglect. \\n197 \\n \\n Bicycles or other wheeled vehicles impounded may be recovered only upon proof of \\nownership and after required fees are paid. Owners are responsible for all costs involved in removal and storage of impounded items . \\nUnclaimed wheeled vehicles shall be held for a minimum of six months by Transportation \\nServices, at which time the owner shall be presumed to have relinquished legal title. Such bicycles shall be disposed of through proper legal procedure . \\nThe CMU Police Department, Facilities Management Services, Transportation Services, or other university departments are not responsible for any alleged damage or loss of \\naccessories or equipment of an impounded vehicle . \\nPets \\nPets are permitted outside on campus grounds when leashed and properly attended. No \\nanimal may be left tied to trees or other objects on campus. In all cases the owner of the \\nanimal is responsible for the animal\\u2019s behavior and any damage caused by the animal. \\nExcept as noted below, students and their guests are not permitted to bring dogs, cats or \\no\\nther pets inside any university buildings, including residence facilities, fraternities and \\nsororities, classrooms, and other academic or administrative facilities . \\nMore information regarding service and emotional support animals can be found through the Office of Disability Resources\\n. \\nMore information regarding pets and housing policies can be found on the Housing Policies \\nwebsite . \\nStudents or student organizations that would like to host an on -campus activity or event that \\ninvolves animals (such as a petting z oo) must receive prior permission. Such requests are \\nencouraged and should be submitted via this form . \\nStudents are expected to properly respect, attend to, care for and treat any pets or animals that they maintain or interact with in any capacity. \\nCommunity members should contact University Police if a problem arises with any animal. Any unattended animal(s) will be picked up and impounded by University Police or Anim al \\nControl officers. Guidelines\\n for how impounded animals are handled in the City of Pittsburgh, \\nwhich can include adoption or euthanasia . \\n198 \\n \\n \\nPolicy Against Retaliation \\nIt is the policy of Carnegie Mellon University to protect from retaliation any individual who \\nmakes a good faith report of a suspected violation of any applicable law or regulation, university Policy or procedure, any contractual obligation of the university, and any report made pursuant to Section 9 of the Carnegie Mellon University Code of Business Ethics and Conduct . \\nCarnegie Mellon faculty, staff, and students shall not in any way intimidate, reprimand or take \\nretaliatory action against any individual who makes a good faith report of a suspected \\nviolation. Individuals who violate this policy shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary \\naction, up to and including dismissal from the university . \\nAn individual who knowingly or intentionally makes a false report of a violation may also be \\nsubject to disciplinary action . \\nReporting Violations \\nIndividuals are encouraged to report suspected violations of this policy or any other legal, policy or contractual obligation through standard management channels, such as to their immediate supervisor or other appropriate University officials.

This Polic y sets forth \\nthe university\\u2019s legal obligations, requirements for and expectations of faculty, staff, students, contractors, and volunteers who operate and/or participate in such programs. The purpose of this Policy is to ensure the safety and well -being o f minors while setting \\nhigh standards to encourage the pursuit of excellence in our engagement, outreach, and \\n204 \\n \\n service to the community. All members of the Carnegie Mellon community, including \\nfaculty, staff, students, contractors, and volunteers, are expec ted to act in accordance with \\nthis policy . \\nThis policy describes three separate and independent requirements: \\n\\u2022 First, in Section II, it describes a \\u201cProgram Registration\\u201d requirement which will allow \\nthe university to ensure that programs involving minors satisfy the requirements of \\nthe Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law, as amended by Pennsylvania Act 153, as well as other best practices related to health, safety, program operation, parental \\npermission, risk management, etc . \\n\\u2022 Second , in Section III, the Policy sets forth the requirements for background \\ncertifications that are required by the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law when \\nworking with minors. These requirements are independent of the program registration requirements in Section II. Before working with minors, please make sure of your \\nobligations under both Sections II and III . \\n\\u2022 Third, in Section IV, the Policy sets forth the requirements for the mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law . \\nI. Definitions \\n\\u2022 The terms \\u201cchild,\\u201d \\u201cminor\\u201d and \\u201cminor child\\u201d are defined as any individual less than eighteen (18) years of age.* \\n\\u2022 \\u201cMatriculated Student\\u201d is defined as a student who is enrolled at Carnegie Mellon and \\npursuing a progr am of study that results in a postsecondary credential, such as a \\ncertificate, diploma or degree.* \\n\\u2022 \\u201cSchool Employee\\u201d is defined as an individual who is employed by Carnegie Mellon or \\nwho provides a program, activity or service sponsored by Carnegie Mellon . This \\nincludes any faculty member, staff member or student- employee.* \\n\\u2022 \\\"Responsible Individual\\\" is defined as the individual designated by a program or activity involving minors who is responsible for the administration of the program and compliance with this Policy. Depending on the nature of the program or activity \\ninvolving minors, the responsible individual may be a faculty member, staff member, \\nstudent, contractor, volunteer or a third- party. \\n205 \\n \\n \\u2022 For purpose of Section II of this Policy, \\\"Programs and Acti vities Involving Minors\\\" is \\ndefined as any program, event, or activity involving one or more individuals under the \\nage of 18 that is either: \\no Sponsored, funded and/or operated by any Carnegie Mellon administrative unit, academic unit, or student organization, regardless of location. This includes \\nprograms and activities conducted on -campus, off -campus, or remotely via the \\ninternet or other means of communication; or \\no Sponsored, funded and/or operated by a third- party entity and conducted on \\nuniversity property. \\nThe definition of Programs and Activities Involving Minors does not include: \\n[20] \\n\\u2022 Academic courses and related programs or activities, where the only minors involved are Matriculated Students, visiting prospective students and visiting / non- degree \\nstudents. (\\nNote: The University Registrar\\u2019s Office monitors non -degree students who \\nare minor children and such students are only permitted to register for a class if the instructor, in his/her sole discretion, is willing and able to obtain appropriate \\nbackgro und certifications under Pennsylvania law.) \\n\\u2022 Any program or activity conducted on University property where the only minors \\ninvolved are Matriculated Students and/or visiting prospective students. \\n\\u2022 Intercollegiate events where the only minors involved are Matriculated Students or students enrolled at another institution of higher education. \\n\\u2022 Events open to the general public where parents/guardians are required or expected \\nto provide supervision for their children (e.g. a sporting event or a theater production ). \\n\\u2022 Minors who are employees of Carnegie Mellon and are paid at least a minimum wage (note: co -workers of employees who are under the age of 18 may be required to \\nobtain background certifications under Pennsylvania Law).\\n[21] \\n \\n20 Exclusion from the definition of Programs and Activities Involving Minors does not necessarily exempt individual faculty, sta ff, \\nstudents, contractors, volunteers, or other third parties from compliance with the requirements of Section II I regarding \\nbackground certifications. Rather, exclusion from this definition exempts the activity from the registration requirements in \\nSection II. \\n * These definitions are based on the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law.\\n \\n21 Unpaid internships (where permitted by applicable government regulations and HR guidelines ) are not exempt from the \\ndefinition of Programs & Activities Involving Minors. \\n206 \\n \\n \\u2022 Human subjects research studies involving minor children that have been approved by \\nthe Institutional Review Board (note: the Office of Research Integ rity Compliance will \\nnotify Child Protection Operations of any human subjects research studies involving \\nminors so that there will be no need to separately register). \\n\\u2022 Routine interactions between family and friends. \\nII. Requirements for Programs and Activities Involving Minors \\nAll programs and activities involving minors must satisfy the following requirements: \\n1. All programs must register with Child Protection Operations, within the Office of Human Resources, and receive approval prior to engaging in any interactions with minors. Child Protection Operations will coordinate with each program or activity to \\ndevelop appropriate procedures and training to ensure the welfare and security of \\nminors who participate in the program. \\n2. The review process conducted by Child Protection Operations will be based on the unique circumstances of each program and include consideration of the following key factors, among others: the nature of the program; the duration of the program; \\nthe entity sponsoring the program; the responsible individual(s); the number of \\nparticipants and age ranges; the number of supervising adults; the facilities to be \\nused; use of overnight accommodations; potential health and safety concerns (e.g., \\nlaboratory use, machinery, swimming pools, motor vehicles); transportation; \\nprotocols for accidents, injuries and emergencies; health and wellness plans; \\nprotocols for drop -off and p ick-up; and one -on-one private interactions with minors. \\n3. Written permission must be obtained from each minor's parent/guardian prior to the minor's participation in any program administered by Carnegie Mellon and/or any \\nprogram administered by a third party on Carnegie Mellon property. \\n4. Each program must identify a responsible individual who will be responsible for the \\nadministration of the program and compliance with this policy. Notwithstanding the \\nrequirements of and/or exceptions to the Pennsylvania Chil d Protective Services Law \\nor similar laws of other jurisdictions, the responsible individual must have valid background certifications under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law or similar laws of the applicable jurisdiction. \\n5. In addition to backg round certifications required by law as described in Section III \\nbelow, each program must ensure that at least one individual who has received \\n207 \\n \\n certifications under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law and appropriate \\ntraining is on site during the program or activity. That is, even if applicable law does \\nnot require any individual in a program to obtain background certifications, at least \\none individual on site during the program or activity must have a background \\ncertification and appropriate training. \\n6. The college, department, unit, or student organization sponsoring the program may \\nadopt background certification standards more stringent than the minimum required \\nby law, such that any individuals participating in a program may be required to \\nobtain background certifications even where such certification is not required by the \\nPennsylvania Child Protective Services Law or other applicable laws. \\nIII. Background Certification \\nAll faculty, staff, students, contractors, and volunteers must satisfy the background \\ncertification requirements for interacting with minors in the applicable jurisdiction. Specifically, it is the policy of Carnegie Mellon University to comply with the background certification provisions of the Pennsylvania Child Protective Servic es Law (23 Pa C.S.A. \\u00a7 \\n6303 et. seq.), as amended by Pennsylvania Act 153 of 2014. Detailed information regarding the requirements of and exceptions to the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law is available on the Human Resources website .\\n[22] \\nThese background certification requirements are separate from the program registration requirements set forth in Section II. Even though a positi on, activity, or program does not \\nmeet the definition of program or activity involving minors requiring registration under Section II, the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (or similar laws in other jurisdictions) may still require background certifications . \\nAs noted above, the University Registrar\\u2019s Office monitors non- degree students who are \\nminor children and such students are only permitted to register for an undergraduate or graduate class if the instructor, in his/her sole discretion, is willing and able to obtain appropriate background certifications under Pennsylvania law . \\n \\n22 The Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (CPSL), as amended by Pennsylvania Act 153, requires any University employee \\nwho has Direct Contact (as that term is defined under the CPSL) with children under the age of 18 to obtain certain background \\ncertifications. However, the CPSL does not apply to University employees whose only interactions with children under the age of \\n18 are limited to matriculated students and/or visiting prospective students. As such, most employees of Carnegie Mellon are not required to obtain background certifications in order to perform their job duties. But if an employee\\u2019s duties include direct \\ncontact with children under the age of 18 who are not matriculated students or visiting prospective students, the employee may be required to obtain background certifications under the CPSL. For more information see https://www.cmu.edu/hr/career/new-\\nemployees/first -day/act -153.html . \\n208 \\n \\n Every employee and volunteer who is subject to the background certification \\nrequirements of this section has an obligation to notify the university if he/she is arrested for, or convicted of, any offense prohibited by the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law. Notice of arrests or convictions must be provided within 72 hours. Notice should be submitted to Child Protection Cle arances\\n within the Office of Human Resources . \\nIf the university receives notice of an arrest or conviction for a prohibited offense or has reasonable cause to believe that an employee or volunteer has been arrested or convicted of a prohibited offense, the university will require the employee or volunteer to immediately obtain new background certifications. In such cases, the university may prohibit the individual from working with minor children pending receipt of new background certification . \\nIV. Mandatory Reporting \\nUnder the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law all school employees are mandatory reporters of child abuse. Volunteers who are responsible for the welfare of a minor or who have direct contact with minors are also Mandatory Reporters . \\nReports of child abuse must be immediately submitted to both : \\na) The Pennsylvania Department of Human Resources. Reports may be submitted: \\na. Orally via the Child Hotline at 1 -800- 932- 0313; or \\nb. Electronically via the website https://www.compass.state.pa.us/cwis/public/home . \\nb) Carnegie Mellon University Officials. Reports may be submitted to: \\na. Your supervisor, or \\nb. University Police, or \\nc. Office of General Counsel \\nBy law a mandatory report must be immediately filed if there is reasonable cause to suspect that a minor is the victim of child abuse in the following circumstances : \\n\\u2022 The Mandatory Reporter comes into contact with the minor in the course of \\nemployment, occupation and practice of a profession or through a regularly scheduled \\nprogram, activity, or service ; \\n\\u2022 The Mandatory Reporter is directly responsible for the care, supervision, guidance, or training of the minor, or is affiliated with an agency, institution, organization, school, \\nregularly established church or religious organization or other entity that is directly \\nresponsible for the care, supervision, guidance or training of a minor ; \\n209 \\n \\n \\u2022 A person makes a specific disclosure to the Mandatory Reporter that an identifiable \\nminor is the victim of child abuse ; \\n\\u2022 An individual 14 years of age or older makes a specific disclosure to the Mandatory \\nReporter that the individual has committed child abuse . \\nMembers of the university community located outside of the Commonwealth of \\nPennsylvania are expected to comply with any mandatory reporting laws of the applicable jurisdiction. Questions regarding mandatory reporting requirements in other jurisdictions should be submi tted to the Office of the General Counsel. \\nAdditional information about mandatory reporting laws in Pennsylvania as well as other jurisdictions is available at https://www.cmu.edu/ogc/Guidance/act_153/\\n. \\nPrematriculation Immunization Policy \\nPolicy Rationale \\nThe university values personal and community health and recognizes the critical role that each individual plays in contribu ting to community health by participating in personal \\nhealth care practices that prevent the spread of contagious diseases. Participation in a vaccination program represents one such highly effective personal health practice . \\nVaccine -preventable diseases p ose a significant threat to the public health of the campus \\ncommunity, impose a significant cost to infected individuals in terms of mortality and \\nmorbidity and impose a cost to other community members by disrupting university life \\nand academic activities. Therefore, the university expects that all individuals will value the \\nimportance of protecting themselves and others by obtaining vaccinations against vaccine -preventable diseases and acknowledges the institution\\u2019s role in supporting public \\nhealth by monitoring the vaccination status of incoming students through its policy on immunization requirements . \\nPolicy Statement \\nThe goal of the university is to provide adequate protection of the campus community against vaccine -preventable diseases. This goal can best be achieved through a \\nprematriculation immunization requirement that is administered by University Health Services (UHS). All students are required to comply with the immunization requirements and the screening protocol for tuberculosis . \\n210 \\n \\n Implement ation Guidelines \\nImmunization Requirements for Students \\n\\u2022 Required vaccinations shall be determined by UHS and shall be consistent with \\nPennsylvania State Law and informed by the recommendations of the American \\nCollege Health Association and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices . \\n\\u2022 Vaccination requirements will be reviewed annually by UHS. Any changes in the \\nrequirements effective in the upcoming school year will be communicated to \\nincoming students and the university community in the spring term prior to \\nimplementation that fall. \\n\\u2022 Application or modification of this policy for non -Pittsburgh locations will be \\ndetermined by the Director of University Health Services, in consultation with relevant colleagues in those locations . \\nAdditional Requirements for Students Residing in University Housing \\n\\u2022 Because vaccine preventable diseases spread more readily in a residenti al \\nenvironment, UHS may set additional requirements for students who elect to live in university housing . \\nRequest for Waiver \\n\\u2022 A student may request a waiver from any vaccination for medical reasons or if \\nvaccination conflicts with personal or religious beliefs by contacting UHS. If an \\noutbreak of contagious disease occurs, the university reserves the right to ask students who have not been vaccinated against that disease to leave campus until \\nthe outbreak is over . \\nScreening Protocol for Tuberculosis \\n\\u2022 Students with an increased risk of exposure to tuberculosis are expected to comply \\nwith screening requirements as set forth by UHS and informed by recommendations \\nof the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control . \\nPenalty for Noncompliance \\n\\u2022 If a student fails to comply with the immunization policy, UHS will notify the University \\nRegistrar who will change the student\\u2019s enrollment status to reflect that the student is not \\nenrolled until the requirements are met. \\n211 \\n \\n \\u2022 Additionally, if the student is a resident in university housing and fails to comply with the \\nimmunization requirements, he/she will be removed from housing. A fee may be assessed \\nby Housing for reactivation of the room key if the student later complies with the policy . \\nRelated Policies and Procedures \\nThe university complies with OSHA regulations regarding occupational exposure to blood-\\nborne pathogens. Questions regarding these regulations should be directed to Environmental Health & Safety, 412 -268- 8182. \\nPublic Art Policy \\nPolicy Statement \\nPublic Art is permanent or long -term art in public spaces on campus. This policy \\naddresses the review, acquisition, acceptance, siting, and deaccessioning of public art. Accepted public art becomes the management responsibility of the Department of \\nCampus Design and Facility Development in the Office of the Vice President for Finance and the Chief Financial Officer . \\nArt enhances the quality of life for all people and should be a part of the daily life of the students, faculty, and staff at Carne gie Mellon. Carnegie Mellon is a leader in education \\nfor the arts and creative research and practice, and art on the campus and in public building spaces should reflect this leadership status. Acquired public art should expand the educational mission of t he university and the College of Fine Arts by providing \\ninteresting and challenging work of high quality, accompanied by an interpretive program to make the works accessible to the non -specialist. \\nThe Public Art Committee (PAC) is established to: \\n1. Review sp ecific proposals for public art with the purpose of recommending to the \\npresident approval, suggestions for modification, or rejection of the public art, and its \\nsiting. \\n2. Clarify the need for public art on the Carnegie Mellon campus and target specific siting opportunities, including both indoor and outdoor public spaces. This work \\nbuilds on the campus master planning process. \\nPublic art is acquired through donations, solicitations, purchases, and loans. It should be \\nrecognized that the advocacy and selec tion of public art can be controversial and, at \\ntimes, technically difficult. Public art selection must address such issues as: artistic \\n212 \\n \\n quality, appropriateness, site context, public sensibility, durability, maintainability, safety \\nand cost . \\nGiven the wo rld class stature of our College of Fine Arts and many of its graduates, the \\nuniversity would be particularly pleased to have the opportunity to consider works by prominent alumni and faculty to celebrate their leadership contribution to their discipline and the world of art . \\nAs the university's financial strength becomes more robust and such funds become available, it is the university's aspiration that major new campus facilities projects will allocate a percentage of project funds for the acquisition, co mmission and/or integration \\nof public art that will enhance the contribution of the new facility to the quality of campus life. If acquisition funding can be raised, consideration must also be given to maintenance and the future maintenance of the art endowed . \\nDefinition \\nPublic Art at Carnegie Mellon is considered to be permanent or long -term art in public \\nspaces on campus, including all outdoor campus space and interior public spaces such as lobbies, social spaces, etc. The PAC does not presume any author ity over works of art, \\nphotographs, etc. that faculty and staff place on view in their offices or that departments install in their offices and teaching spaces. Art is considered permanent if it is installed \\nwith no anticipated time limit or duration. This policy does not address student or faculty \\nart installations with a defined time limit, and which are covered by separate guidelines and coordinated by the College of Fine Arts . \\nProcess \\nThe Public Art Committee is advisory to the president and all proposed public art and its proposed site must be reviewed by the Public Art Committee and approved by the president and the Property and Facilities Committee of the Board of Trustees before it is accepted by the university. The PAC meets on an ad hoc bas is as public art proposals \\nrequire review, or to address other public art planning issues. Recommendations of the \\nPAC shall be upon a vote of the majority of members convened. The Design Review \\nCommittee must be consulted on proposals for outdoor sites t hat require integration into \\nthe campus master plan . \\nIn order to ensure that the PAC has the opportunity to receive input from all campus constituencies, prior to recommending acceptance of a piece of public art the PAC shall \\nhold at least one public meeting which all interested members may attend for purposes of \\nhearing about and offering comment on the proposed piece. Representatives of the \\nprimary user(s) of the space where the public art is to be sited must also be consulted. \\n213 \\n \\n Carnegie Mellon welcomes t emporary installations in public spaces organized by \\ndepartments or individuals. There is no need for the PAC to monitor short exhibits (six \\nweeks or less). Exhibits of the Miller Gallery are also exempted from review by the PAC . \\nPublic Art Committee Membe rship \\nThe PAC is chaired by the dean of the College of Fine Arts. An appropriate staff member \\ndesignated by the provost shall provide administrative support. The PAC is made up of campus representatives who provide necessary judgmental and technical exper tise. Members shall include : \\nEx officio \\n\\u2022 Dean, College of Fine Arts (Chair) \\n\\u2022 Head, School of Art \\n\\u2022 Director, Miller Art Gallery \\n\\u2022 Associate Vice President for Campus Design and Facility Development ( non-voting ) \\n\\u2022 Secretary of the Corporation; Chief of Staff, Office of the President ( non-voting ) \\n\\u2022 Vice President, Advancement ( non-voting ) \\nFaculty \\nThe University recognizes that it is important for the PAC to have wide -ranging input, \\nincluding from faculty of the university who are non- specialists in the fiel d of art. In \\norder to ensure that the views of non- specialist faculty are represented, three faculty \\nmembers shall be appointed on a staggered basis by the deans of the Mellon College of Science, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Institute of Technology, School of Computer Science, College of Humanities and Social Sciences and Heinz School of Public Policy, according to the process set forth below. \\n \\nFor the first year of appointments to the Committee: \\nDean No. of members appointed Term \\nMellon College of Science 1 3 years \\nTepper School of Business 1 2 years \\nCarnegie Institute of Technology 1 1 year \\n214 \\n \\n \\nFor the second year of appointments to the Committee: \\nDean No. of members appointed Term \\nSchool of Computer Science 1 3 years \\n \\nFor the third year of appointments to the Committee: \\nDean No. of members appointed Term \\nDietrich College 1 3 years \\n \\nFor the fourth year of appointments to the Committee, and for every year thereafter, \\none dean shall appoint one member of his or her school's or college's faculty for a three year term in the following order: The Heinz School of Public Policy (Year 4), Mellon College of Science (Year 5), Tepper School of Business (Year 6), Carnegie Institute of Technology (Year 7), School of Computer S cience (Year 8) and College of Humanities and \\nSocial Sciences (Year 9) and so on and so forth such that at all times the Committee shall have three members who are faculty of the aforementioned schools and colleges. The unexpired term of any vacancy creat ed by the resignation or death of any member shall \\nbe filled by the dean that appointed the original member . \\nTrustees \\nTwo trustees, designated by the chair of the Property & Facilities Committee of the Board of Trustees, appointed for terms of two years each. \\nStudents \\nTwo undergraduate students selected by the Student Senate and two graduate students selected by the Graduate Student Assembly, appointed for terms of one year each. \\nStaff \\nOne staff member selected by the Staff Council, appointed for a term of two years. \\nExternal Community \\nOne member, designated by the provost in consultation with the chair of the PAC and the Property & Facilities Committee of the Board of Trustees (e.g. a prominent \\n215 \\n \\n alumnus/a, a Pittsburgh -based museum director, or the head of a regional arts \\norganization), appointed for a term of two years . \\nThe PAC membership also shall include at least one member of the Design Review \\nCommittee (who can be one of the individuals named above) and the Artistic Properties Committee (who shall be the university librarian serving as the university archivist or \\nother librarian designated by him/her). The PAC may call on others in the campus \\ncommunity or outside consultants for their technical expertise as approved by the Provost . \\nCriteria for Acceptance/Rejection of Public Art \\nThe PAC will use the following criteria in considering gifts or purchases of public art: \\n\\u2022 Proposed art shall display a high level of artistic quality and craftsmanship that \\nsupports and enhances the academic and creative m issions of Carnegie Mellon. \\nDistinctive works of art chosen or created for campus public space shall be of sufficiently high quality to merit inclusion into Carnegie Mellon's permanent collection. \\n\\u2022 The \\\"message\\\" of proposed art, if any, shall be acceptable to current standards and policies of the Carnegie Mellon community. \\n\\u2022 An appropriate site in campus public space shall be available. \\n\\u2022 Proposed art shall be structurally sound and present no environmental or safety hazard. \\n\\u2022 An external funding source to cover a ll costs of acquisition, purchase, shipping, \\ninstallation, wall- to-wall insurance, appraisal, and maintenance shall be determined \\nprior to acceptance. If sufficient funding is not immediately available, this criterion may \\nbe waived in exceptional circumsta nces by the president. \\n\\u2022 The donor's clear title to donated art and authenticity of the work shall be confirmed prior to acceptance. \\nOwnership and Deaccessioning \\nOwnership and acquisition terms will be determined by the standard gift agreement \\nbetween the un iversity and the donor of public art. The university, with the approval of \\nthe PAC, reserves the right to sell or donate works of public art. \\n216 \\n \\n Criteria for Deaccessioning \\nThe PAC may consider the deaccessioning of artwork for one or more of the following \\nreasons in the event that it cannot be resi ted: \\n1. A work is not, or is only rarely, on display because of lack of a suitable site. \\n2. The condition or security of the artwork cannot be reasonably guaranteed. \\n3. The artwork has been damaged or has deteriorated and repair is impractical or \\nunfeasible. \\n4. The artwork endangers public safety. \\n5. In the case of site specific artwork, the artwork\\u2019s relationship to the site is altered \\nbecause of changes to the site. \\n6. The artwork has been determined to be incompatible within the c ontext of the \\ncollection. \\n7. The university, with the concurrence of the PAC, wishes to replace the artwork with \\nwork of more significance by the same artist. \\n8. The artwork requires excessive maintenance or has faults of design or workmanship. \\nPublications \\nPublications produced independently by students must clearly state that they do not carry \\nthe endorsement of Carnegie Mellon University. All university -sanctioned student \\npublications must be approved by the Office of the Dean of Students, and they should include the official CMU wordmark and Statement of Assurance . Visit the brand guidelines\\n for \\nmore information. \\nRecycling Policy \\nThis is to announce the adoption of the following Recycling Policy for the university. \\nCarnegie Mellon University is committed to recycling the materials it uses and to minimizing \\nnon-hazardous waste. It is the responsibility of every member of the campus community to \\nsupport these efforts that will protect our environment by conserving resources and preserving rapidly diminishing landfill space. The implementation of a campus -wide r ecycling \\nprogram is the first step toward developing a comprehensive environmental policy for Carnegie Mellon. Recycling is just one part of a much larger program of activities through which Carnegie Mellon will take an increasingly active role to further understanding and preservation of our environment in the years to come . \\n217 \\n \\n Facilities Management Services is responsible for the implementation of Carnegie Mellon's \\nrecycling program. The Environmental Coordinator in this department will be responsible for the management of the recycling program and coordination of waste reduction efforts on \\ncampus. Each department will designate, in writing, an official Recycling Liaison who will coordinate departmental recycling efforts with the Carnegie Mellon Environmental Coordinator . \\nThe entire campus community is expected to actively participate in Carnegie Mellon's Recycling Program and waste reduction efforts. This involves three distinct activities . \\n1. Recycling of paper, cardboard and beverage cans (aluminum and bimetal). \\n2. Source Reduction: This includes but is not limited to making double -sided copies, \\nincreased use of electronic mail instead of memos, reuse/resale of surplus furniture, etc. \\n3. Purchasing products made from recycled materials. The long -term success of recyc ling \\nprograms in this country depends on the creation of markets for recycled materials. All \\ndepartments should purchase recycled products wherever economically feasible. \\nRecycling programs already functioning on campus are encouraged to continue and expand \\nprovided that they do not hinder the campus -wide recycling program. Individuals responsible \\nfor such programs must provide recycling volume data to the Carnegie Mellon University Environmental Coordinator to permit the university to comply with Pennsylva nia Act 101 \\n(Pennsylvania Municipal Waste Planning, Recycling and Waste Reduction Act 101 of 1988) . \\nSafety Intervention Protocol \\nCarnegie Mellon is committed to maintaining a safe and secure environment for students, faculty, staff and visitors and may intervene in circumstances that seriously affect the health or well -being of any student, where physical safety is seriously threatened, or where the \\noperations of the university are seriously disrupted. In keeping with this commitment, this protocol describe s the procedures for assessing potential risk presented by students and \\ninterventions the university may enact . \\nIf safety is an immediate concern, an associate vice president of student affairs (or their designee), may determine the need to issue a mandate that : \\n1. specifies the conditions for a student to maintain (or resume) her/his status as an enrolled \\nstudent; and/or: \\n2. requires a student to absent herself/himself from campus until specified conditions have been satisfactorily engaged or completed. \\n218 \\n \\n Any and all conditions of a mandate will be specified in a written letter from the associate \\nvice president of student affairs to the student. Such conditions may include : \\n\\u2022 A behavioral contract; \\n\\u2022 A no contact agreement/order; \\n\\u2022 Transferring rooms within university ho using; \\n\\u2022 Removal from university housing; \\n\\u2022 Completion of a pending community standards proceeding and/or investigation by the \\nOffice for Institutional Equity and Title IX; \\n\\u2022 Engagement in an appropriate care or treatment plan; \\n\\u2022 Temporary withdrawal from the university; \\n\\u2022 Signed releases of information or communication with support sources such as parents or \\ntreatment providers; and/or \\n\\u2022 Other conditions deemed reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. \\nA mandate will only be issued when, in the professional judgment of an associate vice \\npresident of student affairs (or their designee), after considering all reasonably available \\ninformation, it is determined that the student: \\n\\u2022 Poses a credible substantial risk of harm to individuals within the Univ ersity or to the \\nUniversity community as a whole; or \\n\\u2022 Substantially impedes the lawful activities, the educational process, or the proper activities or functions of members of the University community. \\nThe decision to issue a mandate will be predicated on an individualized assessment of the \\nstudent\\u2019s behaviors. The primary considerations in making this assessment will be the severity of the safety risk presented by the student, the impact of the student\\u2019s behaviors on the university community and the broade r community, the student\\u2019s willingness or \\nunwillingness to voluntarily engage in a level of care that is clinically indicated; and whether reasonable modifications of the university\\u2019s polices, practices or procedures significantly mitigate the risk. Shoul d a mandate be deemed appropriate, the university will identify the \\nstudent affairs staff member(s) who will support and assist the student in meeting specific requirements and associated timelines for completion, which will be outlined in writing by the a ssociate vice president of student affairs. If necessary, the student may be placed on an \\nadministrative leave of absence while completing these requirements . \\n219 \\n \\n A student who receives a mandate under this protocol may appeal the decision in writing to \\nthe de an of students. In connection with an appeal, a student may submit whatever \\nadditional evidence the student believes may be relevant to the decision . \\nSafety Hazards \\nThe occupation, alteration, or use of university facilities that creates a fire or safety h azard \\n(potential or actual), creates danger to individuals or others, or creates a threat to university property is a violation of university regulations and the individual responsible is subject to appropriate disciplinary action . \\nNo use of explosive or incendiary materials on university property in connection with programs or activities may take place without the explicit permission of the dean of students and the director of environmental health and safety or their designated representatives. Failure to abide by this regulation will result in suspension of social and competitive privileges of the organization and/or individual violating the regulation . \\nScheduling of University Facilities \\nScheduling of Space \\nAny Student Senate recognized organization is entitled to reserve available meeting space on the campus without rental fee. Charges for special services may be made if deemed necessary. Any student organization holding a function, dance, or social event in the Cohon University Center with 100 or more pe ople in attendance must employ a campus \\npolice officer for the event. If there are more than 200 people in attendance two officers must be present. The following procedures should be followed in making requests for space and special services : \\n1. Requests for space should be made through the online space request system \\nthrough the Cohon University Center . \\n2. Arrangements for food service should be made by calling Dining Services at 412 -268-\\n2129 or email . \\n3. Arrangements for media technology needs should be made by calling 412 -268- 8855 \\nor email . \\n220 \\n \\n Rules Governing Rental of Space by Non -University Organization \\nA non -university organization is one in which the membership and leadership consist \\nprimarily of individuals who are not members of the Carnegie Mellon community. The \\nmere presence of Carnegie Mellon students and/or faculty in the general membership or even in positions of leadership of an organization does not make it a university organi zation, nor does the fact that the request for facilities is made either by a faculty \\nmember or a student. Where student organizations \\u201csponsor\\u201d non- university \\norganizations as defined above, the request will be treated as if the non -university \\norganization itself had made the request. \\nNon- university organizations may be allowed to use Carnegie Mellon facilities under the \\nfollowing conditions : \\n1. They are organized primarily for professional or educational purposes. \\n2. The request for facilities is submitted in writing at least 30 days prior to the event. \\n3. The presence of the function on campus will not interfere with the normal activities \\nof the university. \\n4. Where there is a question in the mind of the authorizing officer about the appropriateness of the request, it will be referred immediately to the dean of \\nstudents and the appropriate campus administrators. \\n5. When a university group requests facilities for a meeting at which substantial off -\\ncampus attendance would be expected and notice of the meeting would be disseminated beyond the campus, the request must be reviewed with the dean of \\nstudents and the appropriate campus administrators. \\n6. If an event is to be approved that will substantially reduce the facilities available for student use during periods when students are in residence, the request will be \\ndiscussed with the Student Government before final approval is given. \\n7. All requests for the use of Carnegie Mellon facilities by non -university organizations \\nshall be made originally with the Office of Conference and E vent Services at 412 -268-\\n1125 or via email . Permission to use facilities may not be assumed until a room \\nreservation form has been signed by the Office of Conference and Event Services or \\nthe dean of students. \\n221 \\n \\n \\nSexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) \\nI. Policy Statement \\nThe mission of Carnegie Mellon University is to cultivate a transformative educational \\nexperience for its students that is committed to promoting and safeguarding their personal health and well -being. In addition, the mission is to create a collaborative \\nenvironment open to the free exchange of ideas, where research, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish and where individuals can achieve their full potential. It is the policy of Carnegie Mellon University to maintain an academic and work environment that promotes the confidence to work, study, innovate and perform without fear of sexual misconduct. Such misconduct diminishes individual dignity, is co ntrary to \\nthe values of the university and is a barrier to fulfilling the university\\u2019s mission. It will not be tolerated at Carnegie Mellon University . \\nIt is the responsibility of every member of the University Community\\n to foster an \\nenvironment free of sexual misconduct. All members of the University Community are \\nencouraged to take reasonable and prudent actions to prevent or stop such behavior . \\nThe Interim Sexual Misconduct Policy (\\u201cPolicy\\u201d) prohibits the types of misconduct listed below and defined in Section IX (also referred to collectively as \\u201c Prohibited Conduct\\n\\u201d): \\n\\u2022 Sexual Assault; \\n\\u2022 Sexual Exploitation; \\n\\u2022 Sexual Harassment; \\n\\u2022 Stalking; \\n\\u2022 Dating Violence; \\n\\u2022 Domestic Violence; \\n\\u2022 Retaliation; and \\n\\u2022 Violation of Protective Measures. \\nThis Policy is intended to: (1) prevent, eliminate and remedy the effects of Prohibited \\nConduct ; (2) foster an environment where all individuals are well- in formed and supported \\nin reporting Prohibited Conduct ; and (3) provide a prompt, fair and impartial process for \\nall parties once the university is made aware of possible Prohibited Conduct . While these \\nprinciples are clear and straightforward, the detailed procedures set forth in this Policy are necessary to assure that these matters are handled in an impartial, thoughtful and \\n222 \\n \\n thorough manner, consistent with the univ ersity\\u2019s dedication to the integrity of its \\nprocess . \\nFurthermore, on May 19, 2020, the Department of Education issued a Final Rule under \\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 with an effective date of August 14, 2020. The Final Rule governs how cert ain acts of sexual misconduct are defined under Title IX \\nand sets forth the procedures and other requirements for adjudicating claims of such conduct (the \\u201cFinal Rule\\u201d). For purposes of this Policy, the conduct described in the Final Rule shall be referre d to as \\u201c Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct.\\u201d \\nFederal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct is defined as follows : \\n\\u2022 Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct \\u2014 A subset of Prohibited Conduct that rises to a level \\nof severity and pervasiveness such that it is prohibited expressly by the Final \\nRule. Prohibited Conduct meets the definition of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct \\nwhen: \\no A Faculty member or Staff member conditions the provision of an aid, a benefit, \\nor a service on another Faculty member , Staff member , Student , or third party\\u2019s \\nparticipation in unwelcome sexual conduct (commonly known as Quid Pro Quo); \\no A Facu lty member , Staff member , Student or third party engages in unwelcome \\nconduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive \\nthat it effectively denies another person equal access to the University\\u2019s Programs \\nor Activities (commonly known as Sexual Harassment ); or \\no A Faculty member , Staff member , Student or third party engages in Sexual \\nAssault , Dating Violence , Domestic Violence or Stalking . \\n\\u2022 Alleged conduct is Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct (though it may still be Prohibited \\nConduct ) only if: \\no The alleged conduct was perpetrated against a person in the United States; and \\no The conduct took place within the University\\u2019s Programs or Activities . \\n\\u2022 Conduct that does not meet this strict definition for Federal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct is still prohibited by this Policy if it otherwise constitutes Prohibited \\nConduct (also referred to as \\u201cOther Prohibited Conduct\\u201d). \\nFaculty , Staff, Student s, or third parties who violate this Policy may face, as appropriate, \\ndisciplinary action up to and including termination, expulsion, or other actions. \\n223 \\n \\n Nothing in this Policy shall be construed to abridge the free expression of ideas that is \\nessential to the university\\u2019s mission. The discourse conducted in accordance with the university's Freedom of Expression Policy\\n and with the statement on Academic Freedom \\nand Responsibility enunciated in the Appointment and Tenure Policy , whether in written, \\nspoken, or electronic forms, shall be consistent with this Policy. \\nThis Policy is intended to meet the university\\u2019s obligations under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\\u201cTitle VII\\u201d); Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (\\u201cTitle IX\\u201d); the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (\\u201cClery Act\\u201d), as amended by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (\\u201cVAWA\\u201d), with respect to its application to sexual misconduct; and other applicable law and regulations . \\nII. Jurisdiction \\nThis Policy applies to Faculty , Staff, Student s, and third parties. This Policy covers acts of \\nProhibited Conduct committed by or against Students , Faculty , Staff , and third parties \\nwhen the Prohibited Conduct occurs: \\n\\u2022 In a University Program or Activity , including, but not limited to, \\no conduct that occurs on a university campus or other property owned or \\ncontrolled by the university; \\no in the context of university employment; or \\no in the context of university- sponsored study abroad, research, field work, practice , \\nor internship programs; or \\n\\u2022 Outside of a University Program or Activity , \\no but poses a serious threat of harm, \\no has a continuing adverse effect on, or impedes equal access to educational programs or activities, or \\no creates a hostile environment for Students , Faculty , Staff\\n, or third parties. \\nThe university retains discretion to determine whether out -of-program conduct is within \\nits jurisdiction. In making this determination, including off -campus or online conduct that \\nis not part of a University Program or Activity , the university will consider the severity of \\nthe alleged conduct, the risk of ongoing harm, whether both parties are members of the \\nUniversity Community, impact on University Program s or Activities , and whether off -\\ncampus conduct is part of a series of actions that occurred both on and off campus. \\n224 \\n \\n This Policy supersedes any conflicting information in any other university policies with \\nrespect to the definitions or procedures relating to Prohibited Conduct . \\nIII. Prohibited Conduct \\nProhibited Conduct under this Policy includes the following specifically defined forms of \\nbehavior: Sexual Assault , Sexual Exploitation , Sexual Harassment , Stalking , Dating \\nViolence , Domestic Violence , Retaliation , and Violation of Protective Measures . Whether \\nsomeone has engaged in Prohibited Conduct under this Policy will be assessed under a \\nReasonable Person standard. \\nSome Prohibited Conduct , like certain sex based crimes, unwelcome conduct that is \\nsufficiently severe and pervasive, and conduct that conditions an aid or benefit on unwelcome sexual activity, may also constitute \\nFederal Rule Sexual Miscon duct . \\nSome forms of conduct which may be considered inappropriate or unacceptable within the Carnegie Mellon community, such as incivility or bullying, may not meet the definition of Prohibited Conduct\\n under this Policy. However, the university retains discretion to \\nreport the conduct to an internal university department or authority such as Human Resources, Office of Community Standards and Integri ty, or relevant academic \\ndepartment or dean to determine and implement appropriate responsive action, including review for possible misconduct under other university policies. \\nIV. Reporting \\nThe university strives to create an environment where all members of the Carnegie Mellon community are aware of options for informing the university about instances of suspected Prohibited Conduct\\n, how to seek assistance and support, and how to pursue \\nuniversity action for their own protection and that of the entire campus community. This Policy distinguishes the action of reporting from filing a \\nFormal Complaint . Thus, \\ninformation shared about suspected Prohibited Conduct does not automatically trigger \\nformal action or an investigation, as discussed below in Section VI.B. This section outlines the mechanisms for reporting and how the university will respond to information it receives. \\nSome forms of Prohibited Conduct may also constitute crimes. The university also \\nstrongly encourages any individual who experiences, witnesses, or learns of possible criminal conduct to report them to the University Police Department or local law enforc ement. Prompt reporting allows law enforcement to collect and preserve evidence. \\n\\u2022 To report in person: \\n225 \\n \\n o Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX/Title IX Coordinator \\n4615 Forbes Avenue , \\nSuite 330 \\nPittsburgh, PA 15213 \\n\\u2022 To report by phone or email: \\no Please call 412 -268- 7125 or email institutionalequity@cmu.edu \\n\\u2022 To report online, including anonymously: \\no Please go to cmu.ethicspoint.com or call 844- 587- 0793 \\n\\u2022 To report possible criminal conduct: \\no University Police Department \\n300 South Craig Street \\nPittsburgh, PA 15213 \\n412- 268- 2323 \\ncampuspd@andrew.cmu.edu \\nThe university maintains a Resource Guide for individuals who file reports of Prohibited \\nConduct that provides information for community members about filing reports \\nof Prohibited Conduct through the university\\u2019s policies, support resources, community \\nresources, and how to support a friend or family member who has been impacted by such \\nconduct. Individuals who report Prohibited Conduct in Pennsylvania will also be informed \\nof the ir rights as a victim of a crime under Pennsylvania law . \\nA. How to Make a Report \\nAny individual, including Complainants , Students , Faculty , Staff , or third parties are \\nencouraged to submit reports of suspected Prohibited Conduct directly to the Office for \\nInstitutional Equity and Title I X in-p erson, via email, phone call, or online. Reports can also be \\nmade to the university officials listed in Section VIII who are designated with the authority to \\ninstitute corrective measures. \\nThe university encourages all members of the Carnegie Mellon community to report to the Title IX Coordinator any information they learn about Prohibited Conduct\\n. Sharing \\ninformation of concern enables the university to offer support to impacted parties and protects the community from continuance of the alleged misconduct. Third parties should note that a report about possible \\nProhibited Conduct , including Federal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct , does not alone trigger a formal resolution process. Instead, as further explained \\n226 \\n \\n in Section VI.A, a Formal Complaint must be filed in order for the formal investigation and \\nresolution process to commence. \\nCertain employees identified as Responsible Employees must report information to the Title \\nIX Coordinator so that the university can offer support and resolution options to the \\nComplainant . These individuals are listed in Section VIII along with additional information \\nregarding their obligations. \\nUpon receipt of a report, the university will promptly contact the Complainant to discuss \\nappropriate Supportive Measures (see Section V.A) and to explain the process for filing \\na Formal Complaint (see Section VI.A). Complainants are not obligated to respond to \\noutreach from the university and the university will respect this decision, with limited exceptions where it is obligated by law or to act in the safety interest of the community. \\nB. Anonymous Reporting \\nAn individual who is not a Responsible Employee may make a report of Prohibited Conduct to \\nthe Title IX Coordinator, and if preferred, may do so without disclosing one\\u2019s name using the online reporting form listed above and here: \\n\\u2022 cmu.ethicspoint.com \\nDepending on the level of information available about the incident or the individuals involved, the university\\u2019s ability to respond to an anonymous report may be limited. The universit y will, however, take whatever steps it deems appropriate and in the best interests \\nof the overall University Community\\n, consistent with the information available. The university \\nwill never refuse to respond a report solely on the grounds that it was made anonymously. \\nInformation collected through the anonymous reporting line will be shared only with necessary university officials in order to respond to the reported concern. Informa tion is kept \\nconfidential and no personally identifiable information is shared, except as necessary to follow this Policy, without the party\\u2019s consent . \\nC. Reports to Law Enforcement \\nAn individual who experiences, witnesses, or learns of possible criminal conduct may contact law enforcement directly by calling: \\n\\u2022 911 (for emergencies off -campus) \\n\\u2022 University Police Department \\n300 South Craig Street \\nPittsburgh, PA 15213 \\n227 \\n \\n (412) 268- 2323 (for emergencies on -campus) \\ncampuspd@andrew.cmu.edu \\nV. How the University Responds to Reports \\nA. Supportive Measures \\nThe university is committed to helping Complainants continue their education and \\nemployment after experiencing Prohibited Conduct . Regardless of whether a person \\nchooses to pursue an investigation, alternative resolution, a formal resolution, or chooses \\nnot to pursue any further process, the Title IX Coordinator or a designated university official conducts an initial assessment to determine next steps and will initiate contact to discuss the availability of Supportive Measures. \\nSuppo rtive Measures are non -disciplinary, non -punitive individualized services, \\naccommodations, and other assistance that the university offers and may put in place, without fee or charge, after receiving notice of possible Prohibited Conduct\\n. Supportive \\nMeasures are designed to restore or preserve access to the University\\u2019s Programs and \\nActivities , protect the safe ty of all parties and the university\\u2019s educational environment, or \\ndeter Prohibited Conduct , while not being punitive in nature or unreasonably burdening \\neither party. \\nSupportive Measures are available regardless of whether the matter is reported to the university for the purpose of initiating a formal resolution under this Policy and before, after, and regardless of whether a Formal Complaint is filed. A Complainant\\n who requests \\nSupportive Measures retains the right to file a Formal Complaint , either at the time the \\nSupportive Measure is offered or requested or at a later date. Any Complainant that \\nrequests Supportive Measures will be informed in writing of their right to simultaneously or subsequently file a \\nFormal Complaint pursuant to this Policy. \\nUpon rece ipt of a report, the Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will contact \\nthe Complainant (1) to discuss the availability of Supportive Measures and (2) to explain \\nthat Supportive Measures are available with or without the filing of a Formal Complaint . \\nThe Title IX Case Manager helps determine the appropriate Supportive Measure(s) to be implemented. The Title IX Case Manager will assess with the \\nComplainant the unique facts \\nand circumstances of their situation and identify steps to help the individual meet their educational or employme nt expectations. The Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will \\nserve as the point of contact for implementing any identified measures to ensure the burden of implementation does not fall on the recipient of the Supportive Measures. \\n228 \\n \\n Supportive Measures will not be disciplinary or punitive in nature and will not \\nunreasonably burden, or unreasonably interfere with the educational pursuits of, either party. Whether a possible Supportive Measure would unreasonably burden either party is a fact -specific deter mination that takes into account the nature of the educational \\nprograms, activities, opportunities and benefits in which an individual is participating. \\nSupportive Measures may also be requested by and made equally available to Respondents , witnesses, and other impacted members of the University Community\\n. \\nExamples of Supportive Measures include: \\n\\u2022 Academic support services and accommodations, including the ability to reschedule \\nclasses, exams and assignments, transfer course sections, or withdraw from courses; \\n\\u2022 Academic sch edule modifications (typically to separate Complainant and Respondent ); \\n\\u2022 Work schedule or job assignment modifications (for university employment); \\n\\u2022 Changes in on- campus work or university housing location; \\n\\u2022 On-campus counseling services and/or assistance in connecting to community- based \\ncounseling services; \\n\\u2022 Assistance in connecting to community- based medical ser vices; \\n\\u2022 No contact agreements (agreements between parties to stop all attempts at communication or other interaction with one another); \\n\\u2022 Temporarily limiting an individual's access to certain university facilities or activities; \\n\\u2022 Work schedule or job assignme nt modifications; \\n\\u2022 Information about and/or assistance with obtaining personal protection orders; \\n\\u2022 Leaves of absences; \\n\\u2022 Increased monitoring and security of certain areas of the campus; \\n\\u2022 Individualized limitations on the parties\\u2019 communications and interactions with each other; or \\n\\u2022 A combination of any of these measures. \\nThe university will maintain Supportive Measures provided to \\nthe Complainant or Respondent\\n as confidential to the extent that maintaining such \\nconfidentiality would not impair the university\\u2019s ability to provide the Supportive Measures. \\n229 \\n \\n B. Support and Resources \\nAll members of the Carnegie Mellon community may seek support and access resources \\non and off -campus that are available at no cost. The Office for Institutional Equity and \\nTitle IX can assist individuals in accessing these resources or individuals may contact the departments or organizations directly . \\nSome of these resources are designated as confidential. Other resources provide support, but may need to involve the Title IX Coordinator and/or the University Police Department. Regardless of whether the university determines that Prohibited Conduct\\n occurred, the \\nuniversity will offer resources or assistance to Complainants , Respondents , witnesses, and \\nother impacted community members after receiving notice of alleged Prohibited Conduct . \\nThe university will also assist those individuals in identifying and contacting external law enforcement agencies and community resources, when desired by the individual. \\n1. Confidential Resources \\nCarnegie Mellon understands that some individuals impacted by Prohibited Conduct , \\nparticularly conduct involving sexual violence, may not be ready or may not be willing \\nto report through a channel that may lead to an investigation or other university action, no matter how discreet. For such individuals, Carnegie Mellon maintains several \\nconfidential reporting options. \\nThese resources can provide individuals with assistance, support, and additional information. Confidential Resources are prohi bited from disclosing confidential \\ninformation unless (1) given permission by the person who disclosed the information; \\n(2) there is an imminent threat of harm to self or others; (3) the conduct involves \\nsuspected abuse of a minor under the age of 18; or ( 4) as otherwise required or \\npermitted by law or court order. Confidential Resources may be required to report \\nnon- identifying information to CMUPD for crime reporting purposes. \\n2. Campus Resources \\no Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) (Student only) \\n412- 268- 2922 \\no University Health Services (Student only) \\n412-2 68-2157 \\no Employee Assistance Program (Employees only) \\n3. Community Resources \\no Women's S helter and Center of Greater Pittsburgh \\n230 \\n \\n o Pittsburgh Action Against Rape \\no Center for Victims \\no Persad \\nVI. How a Complaint is Resolved \\nA. Filing a Formal Complaint \\nA Complainant who chooses to pursue an alternative or formal resolution to address any \\nreported Prohibited Conduct must begin by filing a Formal Complaint with the Office for \\nInstitutional Equity and Title IX. Filing a Formal Com plaint will initiate an investigation \\npursuant to the university\\u2019s process outlined in Section VI.B below. The university will not \\ncommence a formal investigation or its resolution process without the Complainant or the \\nTitle IX Coordinator filing a Formal Complaint . \\nA Complainant may file a Formal Complaint with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, \\nor by email with submission of a Formal Complaint Form . The Formal Complaint must \\ncontain the Complainant \\u2019s physical or digital signature or otherwise indicate that \\nthe Complainant is the person filing (if the Complainant is under the age of 18 and not \\nenrolled in an undergraduate or graduate program, the University will ordinarily also contact \\nthe Complainant \\u2019s parent or guardian, as permitted by law, to explain the process for filing \\na Formal Complaint). A Complainant may file a Formal Complaint at any time, but significant \\ndelays between the time an incident occurs and conducting an investigation may impede or limit the availability of relevant material and/or availability of witnesses. \\nIn certain circumstances, the Title IX Coordinator may file a Formal Complaint . Whether \\nthe university will begin an investigation in response to a report under these circumstances depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to the wishes of the \\nComplainant , the nature and scope of the alleged Prohibited Conduct , the risk posed \\nto any individual or to the campus community by not proceeding, and/or the University\\u2019s determination about whether its legal obligations compel it to pursue the resolution of a report. \\nAfter a Formal Complaint has been filed, or signed by the Title IX Coordinator, the \\nuniversity will commence its investigation and resolution process. In order for the allegations set forth in a \\nFormal Complaint to constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct , \\nat the time of filing a Formal Complaint, the Complainant must be participating in or \\nattempting to participate in the University\\u2019s Programs or Activities . If the Complainant is \\nnot participating in or attempting to participate in the University\\u2019s Programs or \\nActivities at the time the Formal Complaint is filed, the Title IX Coordinator will review \\n231 \\n \\n the Formal Complaint and determine whether to initiate an investigation of Other \\nProhibited Conduct , as specified in Section VI.B below. \\nB. Investigation Procedures \\nUpon the filing of a Formal Complaint , the Title IX Coordinator (or designee) will review \\nthe Formal Complaint to determine whether the allegations, if true, would constitute Federal \\nRule Sexual Misconduct . If the Title IX Coordinator determines that the allegations in \\nthe Formal Complaint , if true, would constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct , the Title IX \\nCoordinator must commence an inv estigation as set forth below. \\nIf the Title IX Coordinator determines that the allegations in the Formal Complaint , if true, \\nwould not constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct but would constitute Other P rohibited \\nConduct , the Title IX Coordinator will review the Formal Complaint to determine whether the \\nallegations, if true, significantly impact the University Community , represent a potential \\nthreat to members of the University Community , or have some other significant connection \\nto the University Community . Based on this review, the Title IX Coordinator will have \\ndiscretion to commence an investigation as set forth below. \\nThroughout the investigation and adjudication of the Formal Complaint , both the \\nComplainant and the Respondent may select an Advisor of their choice. Details \\nconcerning the role of the Advisor are set forth in the applicable adjudication procedures \\nunder Section VI.C and Section VI.E of this Policy. The role of an Advisor in any hearing \\nmay vary based on the applicable adjudication procedures. \\nAfter deciding to commence an investigation, the Title IX Coordinator will appoint an \\ninvestigator to review, assess and investigate the Formal Complaint (the \\u201cInvestigator\\u201d). \\nThe Investigator may be a staff member in the Office for Institutional Equ ity and Title IX, a \\nstaff member in Human Resources, a staff member in another department at the \\nuniversity, or an external professional. The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that the Investigator has been appropriately trained and is free of conflicts of interest or \\nbias that would impair the investigation. \\nThe Title IX Coordinator will send the Complainant , Respondent and their \\nrespective Advisor s a written notice of investigation. The Investigator will conduct an \\ninvestigation and prepare a preliminary investigative report that fairly summarizes the relevant evidence gathered during the investigation. Prior to preparing any report the Investigator will request relevant information from the parties as well as work to gather other relevant available evidence. Although the ultimate responsibility for gathering available evidence rests with the University, the Univer sity is unable to compel any person \\nto participate in its grievance process. The university cannot access, consider, disclose, or \\n232 \\n \\n otherwise use a party's records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, \\npsychologist, or other recognized pr ofessional or paraprofessional acting in the \\nprofessional's or paraprofessional's capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made and maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the party, unless the university obtains that party's voluntary, written consent. Throughout the investigation the university will provide both parties equal opportunity for the parties to present witnesses, including fact and expert witnesses, and other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence. The parties m ay offer testimony from an expert witness, as \\nspecified in Appendix B\\n to this policy. The preliminary investigative report will be made \\navailable to the Complainant , Respondent and their respective Advisor s in elec tronic or \\nhard -copy format. Any evidence collected during the investigation will also be made \\navailable to the Complainant , Respondent and their respective Advisor s for inspection and \\nreview in electronic or hard- copy format. The Complainant and Respondent will have at \\nleast ten (10) business days to review and respond to the preliminary investigative report. \\nThe Investigator will consider any responses submitted by \\nthe Complainant , Respondent and their respective Advisor s and prepare a final \\ninvestigative report (\\u201cInvestigative Report\\u201d). \\nThe Title IX Coordinator will review the Investigative Report and all relevant evidence to determine whether the allegations, if true, would constitute \\nFederal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct and/or Other P rohibited Conduct. Allegations that would constitute Federal \\nRule Sexual Misconduct will be adjudicated under Section VI.C regarding Adjudication \\nProcedures for Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct . Allegations that would constitute Other \\nProhibited Conduct will be adjudicated under Section VI.E regarding Adjudication \\nProcedures for Other Prohibited Misconduct . In cases involving multiple allegations which \\ninclude Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct and Other P rohibited Conduct , the university \\nreserves the right to decide whether to adjudicate all allegations in a single process under the \\nProcedures for Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct or to separately adjudicate the \\nallegations under separate applicable procedures. \\nWhen the university receives a report of alleged conduct that could constitute Prohibited \\nConduct other than Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct (i.e. Other Prohibited Conduct ) under \\nthis Policy and could violate other university policies, the university, in its discretion, will \\ndetermine which policy/ies and procedures apply and whether action will be taken under multiple policies. \\nWith regard to Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct and Other P rohibited Conduct , in the \\nevent that at the time of a report or the conclusion of an investigation it be comes \\napparent that the alleged conduct, if true, would not constitute Federal Rule Sexual \\n233 \\n \\n Misconduct or Other P rohibited Conduct as defined in this Policy, the matter may be \\nadjudicated under another applicable policy or procedure at the university\\u2019s discretion. \\nFor any allegation of Prohibited Conduct that allegedly occurred before the effective date \\nof this Policy, the university will use the sexual harassment and/or sexual assault policy \\nthat was in effect at the time the Prohibited Conduct allegedly occurred for the purpose of \\ndefining conduct that constitutes a violation of policy. However the matter will be investigated and adjudicated using the current procedures as set forth in Section VI of this Policy. Complaints where all of the alleged \\nProhibited Conduct occurred before the \\neffective da te of this Policy will be adjudicated using the procedures for Other P r ohibited \\nConduct set forth in Section VI.E of this Policy . \\nC. Adjudication Procedures for Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct \\nAppointment of Hearing Officer \\nAfter reviewing the Investigative Report prepared under Section VI.B above, if the Title IX \\nCoordinator determines that the allegations, if true, would constitute Federal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct , the university will conduct a formal hearing. The Title IX Coordinator will appoint \\na hearing officer (\\u201cHearing Officer\\u201d) who will be responsible for presiding over a live hearing and making findings of fact and a determination of responsibility with respect to each allegation in the \\nFormal Complaint . The Title IX Coordinator and/or Investigator are not \\neligible to serve as the Hearing Officer. \\nConduct of the Hearing & Written Determination \\nThe Hearing Officer will conduct a live hearing in accordance with the Hearing Procedures for \\nthe Adjudication of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct [pdf] . The hearing will take place no \\nsooner than ten days after the parties are provided with the Investigative Report. \\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer will make findings of fact and a determination of responsibility with respect to each allegation. The determination of \\nresponsibility will be made using the preponderance of evidence standard. \\nIf the Hearing Officer determines that the Respondent\\n is responsible for any allegation, \\nthe Hearing O fficer will contact the appropriate sanctioning officer, as specified below, to \\nreview the findings of findings of fact and determination(s) regarding responsibility (\\u201cSanctioning Officer\\u201d). The Sanctioning Officer will have sole responsibility for determining the appropriate sanctions and remedies related to any finding of responsibility made by the Hearing Officer. The Sanctioning Officer will provide a written determination regarding sanctions to the Hearing Officer. If the Hearing Officer \\n234 \\n \\n determines that the Respondent is not responsible for any of the allegations, the \\nSanctioning Officer will not be contacted. \\nThe applicable Sanctioning Officer is based on the nature of the Respondent \\u2019s relationship \\nto the university: \\n\\u2022 Sanctioning Officer for Students: Associate Vice President of Student Affairs for \\nCommunity Life or designee \\n\\u2022 Sanctioning Officer for Staff: Associate Vice President & Chief Human Resources Officer \\nor designee \\n\\u2022 Sanctioning Officer for Faculty: Provost or designee \\nThe Hearing Officer will prepare a written determination regarding the findings of fact and \\nthe determination regarding responsibility for each allegation. Where applicable, the written decision of the Sanctioning Officer regarding sanctions and remedies will be attached to or incorporated into the written determination prepared by the Hearing Officer. The required content of the written determination of the Hearing Officer is set forth in the \\nHearing Procedures for the Adjudication of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct \\n[pdf] . \\nNotice of Written Determination \\nThe written determination will be provided to the Title I X Coordinator. The Title IX \\nCoordinator or designee is responsible for providing the Complainant and Respondent with a \\ncopy of the written determination. Both parties must be provided the written determination simultaneously. \\nAdditional Procedures for Sanctions Against Faculty Respondents \\nIn the case of sanctions against a Faculty Respondent , the sanctions determined by the \\nSanctioning Officer for Faculty will be provided to the President as recommended sanctions. \\nThe President will take no action on the recommended sanctions until either (i) the completion of any appeal filed by any party under \\nSection VI.D of this Policy or (ii) the \\ndeadline to file an appeal under Section VI.D of this Policy passes without any appeal being \\nfiled. If an appeal is filed, the President or the President\\u2019s designee will render a decision on the appeal consistent with the procedures in \\nSection VI.D of this Policy. If any sanctions \\nremain after the completion of the appeal or where no appeal is filed by the appeal deadline, the President will thereafter render a decision based on both the recom mendation of the \\nSanctioning Officer for Faculty as well as the underlying findings of fact and determination(s) of responsibility by the Hearing Officer (or Appeal Officer, if applicable). If the President decides to initiate the procedure for dismissal f or cause or for the imposition of another \\n235 \\n \\n sanction against a Faculty Respondent , the matter will then follow the process set forth in the \\nsubsection \\\"Procedure\\\" of the section of the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie \\nMellon University titled, \\\"Dismissal for Cause and Other Sanctions\\\", but will be subject to the \\n\\\"Exceptions\\\" provision of that subsection such that no Ad -Hoc Committee will be required. \\nD. Appeal Procedures for Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct \\nBoth the Complainant and Respondent have the right to file an appeal regarding (i) the \\ndetermination under Section VI.C of this Policy or (ii) the dismissal of a Formal Complaint \\nand/or determination that a Formal Complaint does not constitute Federal Rule Sexual \\nMisconduct . An appeal must be submitted in writing to the Office of the President (with a \\ncopy to the Title IX Coordinator) within seven (7) calendar days of the official notification of the determ ination under \\nSection VI.C . The written appeal request must state the basis \\nfor the appeal. The basis for an appeal will be limited to one or more of the following: \\n\\u2022 Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter; \\n\\u2022 New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination \\nregarding responsibility or dismissal was made, that could affect the outcome of the matter; \\n\\u2022 The Title IX Coordinator, Investigator(s), or Hearing Officer, or Sanctioning Officer had a conflict of interest or bias for or against Complainant s or Respondent\\ns generally or the \\nindividual Complainant or Respondent that affected the outcome of the matter; and \\n\\u2022 The sanctions imposed are disproportionate to the finding of responsibility. \\nThe President or the President\\u2019s designee will serve as the Appeal Officer. The Appeal \\nOfficer will inform the other party or parties that an appeal has been filed and provide such party or parties with a copy of the written appeal. The non -appealing party will have \\na reasonable, equal opportunity to submit a responsive written statement for consideration by the Appeal Officer. \\nThe Appeal Officer will review the written appeal and any response and determine whether, in the judgment of the Appeal Officer, sufficient grounds exist for at least one \\nbasis of appeal. An appeal that does not meet at least one of the acceptable bases for \\nappeal may be dismissed without further review. \\nAppeals will be decided by the Appeal Officer in a timely manner as circumstances warrant. While an appeal is under review, the appeal officer will update the Respondent\\n(s) \\nand Complainant (s) as necessary about the anticipated timeline. \\n236 \\n \\n The Appeal Officer has the authority to modify the decision as they deem appropriate for \\nresolution of the matter being appealed, which could entail (i) sending the matter back to \\nan Investigator, the Hearing Officer, or a new Hearing Officer, as necessary to remedy the error or (ii) a decrease or change to the nature of the sanction(s). The Appeal Officer may also remand the matter for a new live hearing under Section VI.C\\n of this Policy. \\nThe Appeal Officer will issue a written decision describing the result of the appeal and the rationale for the result. The Appeal Office r will provide the written decision \\nsimultaneously to both the Complainant and Respondent\\n. The Title IX Coordinator will \\nalso receive a copy of the decision. \\nE. Adjudication Procedures for Other Prohibited Conduct \\nThe specific procedures for adjudicating allega tions of Prohibited Conduct that, if true, \\nwould not constitute Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct (i.e. Other Prohibited Conduct ) are \\nbased upon the nature of the Respondent \\u2019s relationship to the university. \\n\\u2022 Where the Respondent is a Student \\u2014 the matter will be handled in accordance with \\nthe university\\u2019s Student Community Standards Process, which is set forth in the \\nCommunity Standards section of The Word . Appeals will also be handled in accordance \\nwith the Student Community Standards Process. \\n\\u2022 Where the Respondent is a Staff member \\u2014 the Title IX Coordinator will send the \\nInvestigative Report to the Assistant Vice President, People and Organization \\nEffectiveness, in Human Resources and the matter will be handled in accordance with \\nthe procedures set forth in the Staff Handbook , Volume II, Section 10c . \\n\\u2022 Where the Respondent is a Faculty member \\u2014 the Title IX Coordinator will send the \\nInvestigative Report to the Provost who will appoint a Hearing Officer to adjudicate the matter. The Hearing Officer will conduct a live hearing using the \\nProcedures for Other \\nProhibited Conduct [pdf] . At the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer will \\nprepare a written report regarding findings of fact and a determination of responsibility with respect to each allegation. The determination of responsibility will \\nbe made using the preponderance of evidence standard. \\nThe written report of the Hearing Officer will be provided to the Provost. If the report \\nof the Hearing Officer includes a determination that the Respondent is responsible for \\nany of the allegations, the Provost will make a recommendation to the President regarding applicable sanctions and remedies. The report of the Hearing Officer and, if applicable, the recommendation of the Provost regarding sanctions will be provided to the \\nComplainant , the Respondent , and the Title IX Coordinator. \\n237 \\n \\n The Complainant and Respondent may appeal the decision of the Hearing Officer \\nand/or the sanctions recommended by the Provost to the President. An appeal must \\nbe submitted in writing to the Office of the President within seven (7) calendar days of the notification of the decision of the Hearing Officer to the \\nComplainant and \\nRespondent . The basis for an appeal will be limited to one or more of the following: \\n\\u2022 Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter; \\n\\u2022 New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination \\nregarding responsibility or dismissal was made, that could affect the outcome of the matter;\\n \\n\\u2022 The Title IX Coordinator, Investigator(s), or Hearing Officer, or Provost had a conflict of interest or bias for or against Complainant s or Respondent\\ns generally or the \\nindividual Complainant or Respondent that affected the outcome of the matter; \\nand \\n\\u2022 The sanctions recommended by the Provost are disproportionate to the finding of \\nresponsibility. \\nAppeals will be adjudicated by the President or the President\\u2019s designee. The President \\nor the President\\u2019s designee will issue a written decision describing the result of the \\nappeal and the rationale for the result. The appeal decision will be provided to the \\nComplainant, the Respondent , and the Title IX Coordinator. \\nWhere the Provost recommends sanctions a gainst a Faculty member, the President \\nwill take no action on the recommended sanctions until either (i) the completion of any \\nappeal filed by any party (ii) the deadline to file an appeal passes without any appeal \\nbeing filed. If an appeal is filed, the President or the President\\u2019s designee will render a decision on the appeal and will issue a written decision describing the result of the \\nappeal and the rationale for the result. The appeal decision will be provided to the \\nFormal Complaint, the Respondent , and the Title IX Coordinator. \\nIf any sanctions remain after the completion of the appeal or where no appeal is filed by the appeal deadline, the President will thereafter render a decision based on both \\nthe recommendation of the Provost as well as the underlying findings of fact and \\ndetermination(s) of responsibility. If the President decides to initiate the procedure for \\ndismissal for cause or for the imposition of another sanction against a \\nFaculty \\nRespondent , the matter will then follow the process set forth in the subsection \\n\\\"Procedure\\\" of the section of the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon \\n238 \\n \\n University titled, \\\"Dismissal for Cause and Other Sanctions\\\", but will be subject to the \\n\\\"Exceptions\\\" provision of that subsection such that no Ad -Hoc Committee will be \\nrequired. \\n\\u2022 Where the Respondent has dual -status (e.g. more than one s tatus as Faculty, Staff or \\nStudent) \\u2014 the university has discretion to determine which process to use under \\nSection VI.E depending on the circumstances of the case. \\n\\u2022 Where th e Respondent is a third party \\u2014 The university\\u2019s ability to take appropriate \\ncorrective action against a third party will be determined by the nature of the third party\\u2019s relationship to the university. The Title IX Coordinator will determine the \\nappropria te manner of resolution in accordance with the university\\u2019s commitment to a \\nprompt and equitable process and consistent with state and federal law, regulations, \\nguidance, and this Policy. \\nF. Possible Outcomes & Sanctions from Adjudication \\nPossible outcomes from a violation of this Policy range from educational outcomes to \\nseparation from the university. A detailed list of the possible remedies and sanctions is \\navailable in Appendix A to this Policy . \\nG. Alternative Resolutions \\nThis Policy describes two procedures for the formal resolution of Prohibited Misconduct \\u2013 \\na procedure for the adjudication of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct in Section V I.C and a \\nprocedure for Other Prohibited Conduct in Section V I.E. Separate from these formal \\nresolution procedures, the university offers several forms of alternative resolution (\\u201cAlternative Resolution\\u201d) procedures that may be available on a voluntary basis to resolve \\na \\nFormal Complaint under this Policy. \\nIndividuals interested in an Alternative Resolution should contact the Office for \\nInstitutional Equity and Title IX to discuss options. For information regarding the types of \\nAlternate Resolution procedures that may be available please see Office for Institutional \\nEquity and Title IX website . \\nEither party may request to pursue an Alternative Resolution at any time after the filing of \\nthe Formal Complaint and before a finding of responsibility under Section VI.C or Section \\nVI.E. The Title IX Coordinator has discretion to determine whether the parties will be \\npermitted to pursue an Alternative Resolution. Alternative Resolutions are not available in cases involving a \\nStudent Complainant and a Faculty or Staff Respondent . In gene ral, \\n239 \\n \\n mediation and other Alternative Resolution procedures that are similar to mediation will \\nnot be used to resolve matters involving an allegation of sexual violence (i.e. Sexual \\nAssault , Dating Violence , Domestic Violence or any other form of Prohibited Conduct that \\ninvolves the use of violence). \\nAfter receiving a request to pursue an Alternative Resolution, the Title IX Coordinator will contact both parties to assess mutual interest in the Alternative Resolution. If both parties wish to purs ue Alternative Resolution, and the Title IX Coordinator agrees that Alternative \\nResolution is appropriate under the specific facts and circumstances of the case, the Title IX Coordinator will provide the Complainant and Respondent\\n with a written notice \\nproviding (i) the allegations in the Formal Complaint ; (ii) the specific Alternative Resolution \\nmethod desired by the parties; (iii) details of the procedures for the Alternative Resolution; (iv) a summary of the possible consequences and outcomes of the Alternative \\nResolution, and (v) information regarding the confidentiality and/or accessibility of the \\nrecords of the Alternative Resolution. After receiving this notice, both \\nthe \\nComplainant and Respondent must provide written consent to the Title IX Coordinator \\nin order to proceed with the Alternative Resolution. \\nDuring any Alternative Resolution process, either party has the right to withdraw from the \\nprocess at any time prior to the conclusion of the process. If either party withdraws from \\nthe Alternative Resolution process or if the parties are unable to successfully resolve the matter at the conclusion of the Alternative Resolution process, the matter will proceed to \\ninvestigation under Section VI.B or to adjudication under Section VI.C or Section VI.E\\n, as \\nappropriate. \\nH. Student Emergency Removal \\nWhere there is an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any Students or \\nother individuals arising from alleged Prohibited Conduct , the university may remove an \\nindividual from the University\\u2019s Program or Activity and issue any ne cessary related no -\\ntrespass and no -contact orders during the pendency of the investigation. The university \\nwill make the decision to remove an individual from the University\\u2019s Program or \\nActivity based on an individualized assessment and risk analysis. \\nFor Students , an emergency removal decision will be made in accordance with the Safety \\nIntervention Protocol s et forth in The Word. In the event the university removes any \\nperson on this basis, the university will provide an opportunity for the affected individual \\n240 \\n \\n to challenge the removal promptly thereafter, as specified in the Safety Intervention \\nProtocol . \\nVII. Additional Information about Reporting \\nA. How the Title IX Coordinator and University Police Share Information about Prohibited \\nConduct with Each Other \\nThe university\\u2019s process for addressing Prohibited Conduct is separate from the law \\nenforcement process for addressing crimes. \\nThe university strongly believes that the decision as to whether to report a crime should \\nbe left to the individual(s) impacted by the crime, except in very limited circumstances where there may be an immediate threat to the University Community\\n. The Title IX \\nCoordinator will share de -identified information about reports with University Police for \\nthe purpose of complying with the university\\u2019s federal reporting obligations to facilitate accurate compilation of crime statistics, and to ensure that other public safety responsibilities are addressed. In extremely limited circumstances, the Title IX Coordinator may share identifying information with University Police, for example, where the university is obligated to report a \\u201cTimely Warning\\u201d pursuant to Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (e.g., when a crime has been \\ncommitted on or near University Property which represents a serious, ongoing threat \\nand/or is part of an ongoing pattern). The report does not constitute a criminal complaint to law enforcemen t, although the University Police Department may contact individuals to \\noffer assistance, inquire about their willingness to preserve evidence, or file a criminal complaint.\\n \\nMaking a report to the University Police means that information will be shared with others as is necessary and appropriate. For example, if an individual makes a report of Prohibited Conduct\\n to the University Police Department that has not already been \\nreported to the Title IX Coordinator, the University Police Department will report the matter to the Title IX Coordinator. The purpose of this report is to ensure that the university can take appropriate actions to seek to eliminate \\nProhibited Conduct , prevent \\nits recurrence, and remedy its effects. The Complainant or others may be contacted by \\nthe Title IX Coordinator to follow up on the information received from the University Police Department to offer supportive measures, including filing a \\nFormal Complaint with \\nthe Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX . \\n241 \\n \\n B. Time Frame for Reporting an Incident to the University \\nThe university strongly encourages individuals to report possi ble Prohibited \\nConduct promptly. Although the university does not limit the time frame for \\nreporting Prohibited Conduct , it may be more difficult for the university to gather relevant \\nand reliable evidence or to take corrective action regarding conduct that is reported to have \\noccurred relatively long ago. \\nIf the Respondent is no longer a Student, Staff member , Faculty member , or participant in \\nany university program or activity at the time of the report, or if the conduct does not fall \\nwithin the scope of the Policy, the university\\u2019s ability to take action against the Respondent under the Policy may be limited. The university will, however, also help a \\nComplainant identify other options outside the university, such as local law \\nenfor cement, and provide support and resources. \\nC. Information on Amnesty to Students When Reporting Prohibited Conduct to the \\nUniversity \\nThe university will not pursue university Prohibited Conduct charges against any Student \\nin an investigation under this Policy for potential violations of university policy for personal consumption of alcohol or other drugs ident ified during an investigation, as long \\nas any such violations did not and do not place the health or safety of any other person at risk. The university may, however, initiate an assessment, educational discussion, or pursue other developmental intervention s (non- disciplinary options) to address the \\nalcohol or other drug use. \\nVIII. Obligations of University Employees \\nAll Carnegie Mellon community members are strongly encouraged to report information about potential violations of this Policy to the Title IX C oordinator. Sharing information \\nwith the Title IX Coordinator does not initiate a formal investigation or impose any obligations on the Complainant\\n. However, disclosing information to the Title IX \\nCoordinator enables the university to offer supportive measures to the party so that they may maintain equal access to their education and work environments. \\nResponsible Employees have a heightened obligation to report information of potential \\npolicy violations. All Staff and Faculty who are Responsible Employees are required to \\npromptly share with the Title IX Coordinator all details they receive in the scope of their employment about \\nProhibited Conduct . Responsible Employees can make a report to the \\nTitle IX Coordinator by contacting the Office for Institutional Equity and Titl e IX. \\n242 \\n \\n Failure by a Responsible Employees to promptly share with the Title IX Coordinator all \\ndetails they receive, including names of involved parties, in the scope of their employment \\nabout Prohibited Conduct may subject them to appropriate discipline, up to and including \\nremoval from their position. \\nThe following positions are Responsible Employees : \\n\\u2022 University administrators and supervisors; and \\n\\u2022 Employees holding any of the roles or titles list below, including those serving in an \\ninterim or acting basis: \\nFaculty or Staff Administrators \\n\\u2022 President; \\n\\u2022 Provost; \\n\\u2022 Vice-Presidents (including those serving in associate and assistant roles); \\n\\u2022 Vice-Provosts (including those serving in associate and assistant roles); \\n\\u2022 Deans (including those serving in associate and assistant roles); \\n\\u2022 Department Chairs (including those serving in associate and assistant roles, graduate \\nchairs, and undergraduate chairs); \\n\\u2022 Directors; and \\n\\u2022 Supervisors (i.e., employees who have authority to hire, transfer, suspend, layoff, recall, promote, discharge, reward, or discipline other employees). \\nStudent Affairs \\n\\u2022 All Staff members (including any individual, whether an employee or not, who serves \\nas a coach of a club sports team), excluding administrative assistants, custodial, \\nmaintenance, and dining employees; and \\n\\u2022 Community Ad visors and Resident Assistants in Residential Education. \\nAthletics \\n\\u2022 All Staff members , excluding administrative assistants, custodial, maintenance, and \\ndining employees. \\nUniversity P olice \\n\\u2022 All Staff members . \\n243 \\n \\n Other \\n\\u2022 All Human Resources Staff members (central, school, college, division, and/or unit) who \\nare responsible for handling employment issues, excluding clerical and transactional \\nemployees; \\n\\u2022 All Staff members and Faculty members who provide oversight to or travel with \\nStudents on universit y-related travel abroad, including university -sponsored study \\nabroad, research, fieldwork, or internship programs. Unless designated as \\na Responsible Employees in another role at the university, staff and Faculty \\nmembers who provide oversight to or travel with Students on university re lated travel \\nabroad, are only considered Responsible Employees with respect to concerns they \\nbecome aware of connected to the program with which they provide oversight or \\ntravel abroad with Students ; and \\n\\u2022 Faculty and Staff members serving as identified advisers to student organizations. \\nConfidential Resources, such as individuals employed at CaPS and the University Health \\nCenter, acting in that capacity, are not Responsible Employees . Nevertheless, these \\nindividuals can serve as connection points to Supportive Measures through the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX if desired by a party. \\nResponsible Employees are not required to report when incidents of Prohibited Conduct \\nare communicated/disclosed during a classroom discussion, in an assignment for a class (and in discussions outside of class time (e.g., during office hours) related to the \\nassignment), or as part of a research project directly associated with the class. \\nResponsible Employees also are not required to report information disclosed at sexua l \\nmisconduct public awareness events (e.g., Take Back the Night, candlelight vigils, protests, \\nor survivor speak -outs in which participants may disclose incidents of Prohibited \\nConduct ). \\nIf you are unsure of whether you are a Responsible Employ ee, please contact the Title IX \\nCoordinator in order to help clarify your role and responsibilities. \\nIX. Definitions \\nA. Sexual Misconduct Definitions \\nPROHIBITED CONDUCT means one or more categories of prohibited behavior including: \\n\\u2022 Sexual Assault ; \\n244 \\n \\n \\u2022 Sexual Exploitation ; \\n\\u2022 Sexual Harassment ; \\n\\u2022 Dating Violence ; \\n\\u2022 Domestic Violence ; \\n\\u2022 Stalking ; \\n\\u2022 Retaliation ; and \\n\\u2022 Violation of Protective Measures . \\nDefinitions for each of the t ypes of Prohibited Conduct are provided below. \\nSEXUAL HARASSMENT means any unwelcome conduct or cues of a sexual nature, whether \\nverbal/aural (sounds), visual/graphic (e.g. pictures and videos), physical, or otherwise, when: \\n\\u2022 Submission to such conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition \\nof a person\\u2019s employment, education, living environment, or participation in any \\nUniversity Program or Activity (commonly known as Quid Pro Quo); \\n\\u2022 Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for or a \\nfactor in decisions affecting that individual\\u2019s employment, education, living \\nenvironment, or participation in a University Program or Activity (commonly known as \\nQuid Pro Quo); and/or \\n\\u2022 Such conduct creates a hostile environment. A hostile environment exists when the unwelcome conduct of a se xual nature is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive \\nthat it unreasonably interferes with an individual\\u2019s participation in a university program or activity or creates an intimidating, hostile, offensive, or abusive \\nenvironment for that individual\\u2019s participation in a University Program or Activity\\n \\n(commonly known as Hostile Environment). \\nExamples of conduct that may constitute Sexual Harassment include but are not limited to: \\no Unwanted intentional touching that otherwise does not typically constitute Sexual \\nAssault, defined in this Policy; \\no Unwanted sexual advances, including repeated unwanted requests for dates, or repeated unwanted requests for sexual contact; \\no Unwanted written, verbal, or electronic statements of a sexual nature, including sexually suggestive comments, jokes, videos or innuendos; \\n245 \\n \\n o Exposing one\\u2019s genitalia, breasts, or buttocks, to another; and/or \\no Touching oneself sexually for others to view. \\nThis definition addresses intentional conduct. It also includes conduct that results in \\nnegative effects even though such negative effects were unintended. Unwelcome conduct \\nof a sexual nature constitutes Sexual Harassment if a Reasonable Person would consider \\nit sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive as to interfere unreasonably with academic, \\nother educational, or employment performance or participation in a university activity or \\nliving environment. \\nSEXUAL ASSAULT means a physical, sexual act directed against another person without their \\nConsent , including instances where the victim is incapable o f giving Consent . Sexual Assault \\ncan occur between two individual of the same or different sexes and/or genders. This \\nincludes the following: \\nI. RAPE means the carnal knowledge of a person, without the Consent of the victim, \\nincluding instances where the victim does not have the Capacity to give Consent ; \\nII. SODOMY means oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, without the \\nConsent of the victim, including instances where the victim does not have the \\nCapacity to give Consent ; \\nIII. SEXUAL ASSAULT WITH AN OBJECT means to use an object or instrument to \\nunlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of \\nanother person, without the Consent of the victim, including instances where the \\nvictim does not have the Capacity to give Consent ; \\nIV. FONDLING means the touching of the private body parts of another person for the \\npurpose of sexual gratification, where the victim does not have the Capacity to give \\nConsent ; \\nV. INCEST means sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other \\nwithin the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law; or \\nVI. STATUTORY RAPE means sexual intercourse with a person who is under the \\nstatutory age of Consent in the applicable jurisdiction. \\nIn the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the age of consent for sexual activity is 16. Minors aged 16 years of age or older can legally consent to sexual activity with anyone they choose, as long as the other person does not have authority over them \\nas defined in Pennsylvania\\u2019s institutional sexual assault statute. Minors under the \\nage of 13 cannot consent to sexual activity. Minors aged 13 -15 years old cannot \\n246 \\n \\n consent to sexual activity with anyone who is 4 or more years older than they are at \\nthe time of the activity. \\nDATING VIOLENCE means any act of violence, including sexual violence, physical violence, or \\nthe threat of such violence, committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship \\nof a romantic or intimate nature with the victim and where the existence of such a relationship is determined based on a consideration of the length, type, and frequency of interactions between the persons involved in the relationship. \\nDOMESTIC VIOLENCE means any act of violence, including sexual violence, physical violence, \\nor the threat of such vi olence, committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner \\nof the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction receiving grant monies, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person's acts under the domestic or fa mily violence laws of \\nthe jurisdiction. \\nSTALKING means engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would \\ncause a Reasonable Person to fear for his or her safety or the safety of others or suffer \\nsubstantial emotional distress. \\nSEXUAL EXPLOITATION \\nmeans intentionally or knowingly taking sexual advantage of another person or violating the sexual privacy of another when \\nConsent is not present. This includes, but is not limited to, \\nthe following actions (including when they are done via electronic means, methods or \\ndevices): \\n\\u2022 engaging in sexual voyeurism including observing or permitting others to witness or \\nobserve the sexual or intimate activity (e.g., disrobing, bathing, toileting) of another person without that person\\u2019s Consent\\n; \\n\\u2022 engaging in indecent exposure, or exposing intimate parts (including genitalia, groin, breasts and/or buttocks), or causing another to expose intimate parts when Consent\\n is \\nnot present; \\n\\u2022 recording or distributing information, images or recordings of any person engaged in sexual or intimate activity in a private space without that person\\u2019s Consent\\n; \\n\\u2022 prostituting another individual; \\n247 \\n \\n \\u2022 causing Incapacitation of another person (through alcohol, drugs or other means) for \\nthe purpose of compromising that person\\u2019s ability to give Consent to non- consensual \\nsexual activity; or \\n\\u2022 actively aiding or assisting another person in committing an act of Prohibited Con duct . \\nRETALIATION means an adverse (negative) action taken against a person for making a \\ngood faith report of Prohibited Conduct , being alleged to have committed Prohibited \\nConduct , participating, or refusing to participate, in any proceeding under this Policy. \\n\\u2022 Retaliation may include intimidation, threats, coercion, harassment, or discrimination \\n(including charging a Respondent under a different university policy instead of this \\nPolicy for the purpose of interfering with any right or privileged secured by Title IX or \\nits implementing regulations). \\n\\u2022 Retaliation may also include adverse employment or educational actions that would \\ndiscourage a Reasonable Person from engaging in a Protected Activity protected under \\nthis Policy. \\nA finding of retaliation under this Policy is not dependent on a finding that the underlying \\nsexual misconduct occurred. Retaliation is also prohibited by the university\\u2019s Policy Against \\nRetaliation . \\nSupportive Measures and other actions taken in accordance with this or other university \\npolicies generally do not constitute Retaliation. Similarly, charging an individual with a code of conduct violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of a \\ngrievance proceeding under this Policy does not constitute prohibited Retaliation, provided, \\nhowever, that a determination regarding responsibility, alone, is not sufficient to conclude that \\nany party made a materially false statement in bad faith. Retaliation also does not include \\npursuit of civil, criminal, or other legal action, internal or external to the university. \\nPROTECTED ACTIVITY means participating in the university\\u2019s processes related to this \\nPolicy, including but not limited to reporting Prohibited Conduct ; pursuing a resolution of \\nProhibited Conduct ; providing evidence in any investigation or hearing; or intervening to \\nprotect others who may have suffered Prohibited Conduct . \\nB. Definitions Relating to Consent \\nCONSENT means a knowing and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity at the \\ntime of the activity. In order to be valid, consent must be knowing, voluntary, active, \\n248 \\n \\n present and ongoing. Consent should be demonstrated through mutually understandable \\nwords or actions. \\n\\u2022 Silence, remaining still or inactive (passive), or not actively resisting sexual activity does not imply consent. \\n\\u2022 Consent to engage in one sexual activity does not mean consent to engage in another sexual activity. Consent must be obtained each time, at each step of sexual activity. \\n\\u2022 Prior consent does not mean future consent. Consent must be obtained each time, at \\neach step of sexual act ivity, even for those in an ongoing sexual relationship. \\n\\u2022 Consent can be withdrawn at any time. If one individual withdraws consent through clear words or actions, the other person must cease sexual activity immediately. \\n\\u2022 Consent cannot be obtained through Force , Incapacitation or Coercion\\n (as defined \\nhere in). \\nFORCE means using physical control (such as restraining a person), physical violence (such \\nas hitting, choking or displaying a weapon), or threats of either to cause a person to \\nsubmit to unwanted sexual activity. \\nCOERCION means using an unreasonable amount of pressure or threats that would \\novercome the will of a Reasonable Person and cause them to submit to unwanted sexual \\nactivity. Coercion requires more than an attempt to persuade someone to engage in \\nsexual activity. Coercion can include threats, such as threats to cause academic, employment, reputational or economic harm. When one person expresses that they do \\nnot consent to sexual activi ty or are withdrawing consent for sexual activity, applying \\ncontinued pressure in order to get the person to submit to unwanted sexual activity can be considered Coercion. \\nINCAPACITATION means that a person lacks the ability to make informed, deliberate \\nchoices about whether or not to engage in sexual activity. A person is Incapacitated \\u2014 \\nunable to give consent \\u2014 because they are: \\n\\u2022 under the age of consent (generally 16 years of age in Pennsylvania; see definition of Statutory Rape\\n for additional information); \\n\\u2022 physically or mentally helpless; \\n\\u2022 asleep or unconscious; or \\n\\u2022 unaware that sexual activity was requested, suggested, initiated and/or is taking place. \\n249 \\n \\n A person may be Incapacitated by the use of alcohol or other drugs. Incapacitation is a state \\nbeyond intoxication or drunkenness. A person is not necessarily Incapacitated solely as a result \\nof drinking or using drugs; the level of impairment must be significant enough to render the \\nperson unable to give Consent . \\nFor example, a person who is Incapacitated may not be able to answer some or all of the following questions: \\no Do you know where you are? \\no Do you know how you got here? \\no Do you know what is happening? \\no Do you know whom you are with? \\nA person who is Incapacitated may also demonstrate physical signs including but not limited to: \\no slurred or incomprehensible speech; \\no unsteady manner of walking or inability to walk; \\no vomiting or incontinence (a lack of voluntary control over urination and/or defecation). \\nIf a person under the influence of alcohol or drugs decides to participate in sexual activity that \\nthey would not part icipate in while sober, it does not necessarily mean that the person was \\nIncapacitated or that the Consent was not valid. \\nImportantly, being impaired by alcohol or other drugs is not a defense to a failure to obtain \\nConsent. \\nCAPACITY means that the person has the ability under the law to give Consent to engage \\nin sexual activity. This means that the person must be: \\n\\u2022 Of legal age to give Consent (generally at least 16 years of age in Pennsylvania; see \\ndefinition of Statutory Rape for additional information); and \\n\\u2022 Able to make informed, deliberate choices about whether or not to engage in sexual \\nactivity. \\nA person who is not able to give consent is considered to be Incapacitated. \\nC. Policy Definitions \\nACTUAL KNOWLEDGE means that the university has notice of alleged Sexual Misconduct \\nbecause the alleged misconduct has been reported to the Title IX Coordinator or any \\nofficial of the university who has the authority to institute corrective measures on behalf \\n250 \\n \\n of the univers ity. These are individuals whose \\u201cactual knowledge\\u201d may be imputed to the \\nuniversity. \\nADVISOR : An individual who provides support and advice for the Complainant or \\nRespondent . The Complainant and Respondent may have an Advisor of their choice, who \\nmay be, but is not required to be, an attorney. \\nIf either party does not have an Advisor present at the live hearing conducted under \\nSection VI.C, the university will provide, without fee or charge to that party, a substitute \\nAdvisor of the university\\u2019s choice who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney.

This commitment extends to encouraging and supporting the reduction of significant health risks to members of the community. Smoking of tobacco products is one such risk. This Policy is intended not only to relieve community members from negative effects of tobacco smoking by others, but also to promote and assist smoking cessation by existing users and discourage new addictions . \\nPolicies that strictly regulate s moking have been demonstrated to reduce exposure to \\nsecond -hand smoke, tobacco- related death and disease, and attendant healthcare costs. \\nIn addition, several systematic reviews of studies have demonstrated effectiveness of such policies in reducing the pr evalence of tobacco use, increasing the number of tobacco \\nusers who quit, and reducing the initiation of tobacco use among young people. These positive effects have led leading national health organizations to advocate a smoke -free \\npolicy intervention. Benchmarking suggests that a \\u201csmoke -less\\u201d approach, an alternative \\nto prohibition that honors our campus geography and is grounded in sustained and visible efforts to reduce smoking and promote cessation, can also have positive effects . \\nThe effects of exposur e to smoke from tobacco were documented in the 2006, 2010, and \\n2014 U.S. Surgeon General\\u2019s Reports. Further research is needed to determine the public health risks and benefits of e -cigarettes and other novel nicotine products. Although \\nharmful consequence s of e -cigarette vapor have not been demonstrated to the standards \\n257 \\n \\n used for conventional cigarettes, the practice of using these products may have social \\nimpact. In addition, some state and local governments, including Allegheny County, have passed laws re gulating the use of e -cigarettes. Therefore, this Policy addresses both the \\nsmoking of tobacco products and the use of e -cigarettes. As evidence becomes more \\nconclusive, this Policy may be amended to further address novel nicotine products . \\nPolicy Statemen t \\nSmoking of tobacco products is prohibited in all university buildings and facilities owned, leased, or operated by Carnegie Mellon University, including campus vehicles. Smoking of tobacco products is also prohibited on all grounds and outside areas except for limited designated outdoor areas where the negative effects of second -hand exposure is deemed \\nsufficiently low. As such, major campus thoroughfares, gathering spaces and entrances to buildings are not designated areas. The number, nature and location of designated areas was determined by an oversight committee convened by the university\\u2019s Environmental Health & Safety department and comprised of representatives from Faculty Senate, Graduate Student Assembly, Staff Council and Student Senate . \\n\\u2022 Designated Smoking Areas [pdf]\\n \\n\\u2022 Tobacco Cessation Resources [pdf] \\nUse of e -cigarettes and vaporizers is prohibited inside all university buildings and inside all \\nproperty owned, leased or operated by Carnegie Mellon University, but is not prohibited outside on campus grounds as of the adoption of this Policy. \\nFor the purpose of this Policy, a tobacco product is defined as any product made or \\nderived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption by smoking. Examples of tobacco products include, b ut are not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, little cigars, and pipe \\ntobacco . \\nFor the purpose of this Policy, an e -cigarette is defined as any electronic oral device, such \\nas one composed of a heating element, battery or electronic circuit, which provides a \\nvapor of nicotine or any other substances and the use or inhalation of which simulates \\nsmoking. The term shall include any such device, whether manufactured, distributed, marketed or sold as an e -cigarette, e -cigar or e -pipe or under any other product name or \\ndescriptor . \\nThis Policy does not apply to the use of tobacco products, e -cigarettes or vaporizers for \\nofficial academic research so long as such use of these products complies with all applicable local, state, and federal laws . \\n258 \\n \\n \\nSocial Regulations \\nEvent s that are in any way identified with Carnegie Mellon and are conducted by students \\nor student organizations for purely social purposes are covered by the following \\nregulations : \\n\\u2022 Any such event, whether on or off campus, must comply with city, state and fed eral \\nlaws. Carnegie Mellon accepts no responsibility for the direct supervision of the social \\nactivities engaged in by its students and student organizations. \\n\\u2022 Student organizations must submit this form to the Director of Student Leadership, \\nInvolvement and Civic Engagement for review and approval prior to any events being \\nheld during final examinations, during final examinations, on the night before any \\nrecess, or during any recess of more than three days duration. \\n\\u2022 It is expected that students will organize and conduct social activities in a responsible manner. \\n\\u2022 The university reserves the right to review the planning for social events requiring the use of university facilities and to establish special requirements as needed to ensure \\nthe well- being of all students. \\nLast revised Spring 1998. \\nStatement of Assurance Policy \\nThe Statement of Assurance must be placed in all graduate and undergraduate admissions \\npublications and all other publications where such a statement is necessary or appropriate. \\nAlso, the Carnegie Mellon Writer's Style Guide gives detailed guidance on how to use the \\nstatement of assurance in campus -related publications. \\nCarnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment, or \\nadministration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon University does not discr iminate and is required not to discriminate in violation of federal, state, or local laws \\nor executive orders. \\nInquiries concerning the application of and compliance with this statement should be directed to the Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX, Carnegie Mellon University, 4615 Forbes Avenue, Suite 330 , Pittsburgh, PA 15213, telephone 412- 268- 7125. \\nObtain general information about Carnegie Mellon University by calling 412 -268- 2000. \\n259 \\n \\n \\nSteam Tunnels \\nBecause of the danger to all who enter them, the steam tunnels are locked and anyone \\nfound in the tunnels will be subject to serious disciplinary action and/or criminal action. The University Police are responsible for keeping the tunnels locked and apprehending anyone who trespasses in them . \\nStudent Accounts Receivable Collection Policy and Procedures \\nPlease refer to the current Student Financial Obligation Statement . That statement is \\nprovided to a ll students through the Student Information Online (SIO). Questions about this \\nstatement may be directed to The HUB . \\nStudent Damage to Carnegie Mellon Property Policy \\nStudents will be charged with the cost of restoring to its proper condition any Carnegie Mellon property that, through their negligence or misuse, has been damaged. \\nResponsible parties will be subject to disciplinary action if said damages are found to have been intentional or caused as a result of improper behavior. All such damages should be reported promptly to the Campus Police. \\nWhen individual responsibility cannot be assigned, the members of the group to whom a space has been assigned or property supplied may be charged (as individuals) for the cost of repairs, and may be subject to disciplinary action. \\nStudent Enterprises \\nStudents who wish to form a student -run business or enterprise must submit a proposal in \\nwriting for approval by the dean of student affairs, the vice president for campus affairs and chief financial officer. Any approved enterprise will be required to pay a university overhead charge, which will be determined in negotiations with the Division of Finance . \\nStudent Health Insura nce Policy \\nPolicy Rationale \\nThe cost of health care in the United States presents a potentially serious health risk and financial risk to students and their accompanying dependents. The absence of adequate health insurance coverage is a barrier to care that can result in temporary or permanent \\n260 \\n \\n interruption of a student\\u2019s education. The university is committed to offering student \\nhealth insurance that provides access to quality health care and achieves a balance between premium cost and adequate coverage without overburdening students\\u2019 financial resources. This balance is best achieved through a student health insurance requirement that mitigates the effect of adverse selection while providing another option for coverage . \\nPolicy Statement \\nAll full- time stude nts are required to carry health insurance that meets certain standards \\nof coverage. In the absence of adequate health insurance coverage, the student is \\nrequired to enroll in the student health insurance plan. \\nImplementation Guidelines \\nThe process for se lection of vendors for the student health insurance plan shall adhere to \\ninstitutional requirements relative to competitive vendor selection processes. The student health insurance program shall be reviewed annually by University Health Services (UHS) and student consumers including representatives from Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly to ensure that the program meets the needs of covered individuals, provides the desired level of benefit at the least possible cost and returns as much of the \\npremium to covered individuals in the form of benefits as possible . \\nThe health insurance program shall be available to all eligible students without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender ident ity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, pre -existing medical or mental \\nhealth condition or genetic information . \\nAll full- time students will be assessed a charge for the individual basic health insurance \\nplan offered through the university s tudent health insurance program. The charge will \\nappear on the invoice of the first semester of attendance in the academic cycle. The \\nstudent is expected to actively enroll in the plan or apply for a waiver from the student insurance plan during the open enrollment. Failure to take action will result in automatic enrollment in the student health insurance plan . \\nApplication or modification of this policy for non -Pittsburgh locations will be determined \\nby the Director of University Health Services, in consul tation with relevant colleagues in \\nthose locations . \\nRequirements for Waiver \\nApplication for waiver from the university student health insurance plan must be submitted to UHS by the last day of the open enrollment period. Students applying for \\nwaiver must provide documentation of : \\n261 \\n \\n \\u2022 Coverage by a carrier that has offices based in the U.S. \\n\\u2022 Continuing coverage that verifies enrollment as the dependent, partner/spouse or \\nprincipal in an employer, state or federally operated insurance Exchange or government sponsored insurance plan. \\n\\u2022 Enrollment in a plan that meets certain minimum standards for coverage as set forth by the university including but not limited to an adequate level of coverage for medical, mental health and substance abuse services at the primar y, emergency, \\ninpatient and outpatient level in the geographic location of study. \\nFailure to maintain continuous coverage will result in automatic enrollment in the student \\nhealth insurance standard plan. \\nUnauthorized Possession of Keys \\nStudents found using or having in their possession key(s) or key card(s) to any university doors or facilities that they are unauthorized to use or possess will be subject to disciplinary action . \\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)/Drones \\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), inc luding aircraft commonly known as drones, are used at \\nCarnegie Mellon University in a variety of ways related to academics, research, business and recreation. All members of the Carnegie Mellon community and guests on university property are expected to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding the operation of UAS. In particular, all outdoor UAS operations must comply with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations.

In general, each member should : \\n\\u2022 Respect the rights of others; \\n\\u2022 Respect the property of individuals, groups and Carnegie Mellon; \\n\\u2022 Know, understand and abide by all Carnegie Mellon community standards, policies and \\nregulations, as well as all local, state and federal laws; \\n\\u2022 Engage in behavior that does not interfere with individual, group or Carnegie Mellon regular \\nactivities and/or operation; \\n\\u2022 Ensure that guests behave in a manner consistent with and in accordance with the expectations of our community. \\nAt the core, our standards, policies and procedures are designed to: \\n\\u2022 promote and protect the rights of all members and guests of our community; \\n\\u2022 promote and protect the hea lth and safety of all members and guests of our community; \\n\\u2022 promote the respect of and protect community members\\u2019 and University property; \\n\\u2022 promote and protect the academic integrity of our community. \\nThe Word provides a list of policies students are expected to uphold and the process by which \\nviolations will be addressed. Policies and procedures may be established or amended as \\nnecessary during the course of the academic year, which will become effective immediately upon notification by the dean of students . \\nIn all cases involving infractions of community standards (excluding the adjudication of Federal \\nRule Sexual Misconduct under Section VI.C of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) the \\nfollowing procedures will be used: \\n268 \\n \\n 1. The Resolution Review Board will review the case and determine the appropriate venue for \\nresolution. \\n2. When appropriate, an Administrative Resolution Meeting will take place with a university adjudicator. If the student respondent and the university adjudicator can resolve the \\nmatter, the student will be notified in writing of the determined action once said action is \\napproved by the Resolution Review Board . \\n3. When the University Disciplinary Committee is assigned original jurisdiction or when \\nAdministrative Resolution has failed, the procedures outlined in the Conduct of University \\nDisciplinary Committee Hearings will apply . \\nA student who requires accommodations due to a disability in order to full participate in the \\ncommunity standards process should contact the Carnegie Mellon University Office of Disability \\nResources which provides responsive and reasonable accommodations to students who self -\\nidentify as having a disability, including physical, sensory, cognitive and emotional disabilities . \\nThe university\\u2019s policy on Student Accommodations is available at https://www.cmu.edu/disability -resource s/policies -guidelines/\\n. Additional information regarding \\nthe Office of Disability Resources, including how to request accommodations, is available at \\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/disability -resources/ . \\nCommunity Standards Violations \\nThe following are groups of violations that constitute misconduct for which members of the student body may be held accountable. This list references policies that may be outlined in \\ngreater detail in this on -line handbook or other campus resources. The university is not limited \\nby this list nor by other published policies when it initiates community standards actions since it \\nis not possible to anticipate all of the behavior of a college population. Additionally, University departments and units may maintain specific policies or guidelines enforceable by their respective procedures separate from community standards action (e.g. University Libraries, Transportation Services, Environmental Health and Safety, Office for Institutional Equity and Title \\nIX, etc.) . \\nThe university reserves the right to review off -campus incidents to determine if a violation of \\ncommunity standards has occurred and whether resolution through the appropriate process i s \\nwarranted . \\n \\n269 \\n \\n Students at Carnegie Mellon are members of an academic community dedicated to the \\nachievement of excellence. Therefore, students are expected to meet the highest standards of \\nintegrity in their conduct. Fai lure to meet the expectations of high standards of integrity may be \\nreviewed through the university community standards process . Examples of violations of \\ncommunity standards in relation to integrity include, but are not limited to : \\n\\u2022 Altering, falsifying, or misuse of university documents \\n\\u2022 Destruction of another person's work, specifically through the use of computer facilities \\n\\u2022 Falsification of data \\n\\u2022 Intentional misrepresentation of self or another individual through electronic communication \\nor any other means \\n\\u2022 Invasion of or accessing personal files or a computer account other than one's own \\n\\u2022 Misrepresentation of research data \\n\\u2022 Misuse of computer facilities \\n\\u2022 Other acts that compromise the integrity of the academic process \\n\\u2022 Providing false information to a university official \\n\\u2022 Reverse engineering software or hardware without permission of the intellectual property \\nowner \\n\\u2022 Violation of copyright laws including computing or Web- related documentation \\n\\u2022 Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Computing Policy \\n\\u2022 Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Policy on Academic Integrity including cheating, \\nplagiarism or unauthorized assistance \\n\\u2022 Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Policy on the Protection of C hildren in Carnegie \\nMellon University Programs, Activities and Facilities \\n \\nCarnegie Mellon University holds as its highest priority the welfare of its community members. \\nAny behavior that places individuals or the community at risk for harm may be reviewed \\nthrough the university community standards process. The outcomes that may result from this \\ntype of behavior may be severe . Examples of violations of community standards in relation to \\nthe welfare of others include, but are not limited to : \\n\\u2022 Assault \\n270 \\n \\n \\u2022 Endangering the welfare of others \\n\\u2022 Failure to enact the Active Medical Assistance Protocol (AMAP) \\n\\u2022 Harassment \\n\\u2022 Hazing \\n\\u2022 Hosting and/or participating in a disorderly event \\n\\u2022 Possession, production and/or distribution of child pornography \\n\\u2022 Tampering with or altering of life support systems \\n\\u2022 Threats of physical violence \\n\\u2022 Unreasonable noise \\n\\u2022 Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Statement of Assurance, including violations of \\ndiscriminatory harassment, disparate treatment discrimination, and retaliation \\n\\u2022 Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) including \\nviolations of sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic \\nviolence, stalking, retaliation, and violation of protective measures \\n\\u2022 Violation of a No Contact Agreement or No Contact Order \\n \\nThe care and upkeep of our campus buildings, grounds and facilities are critical to providing \\nstudents, faculty and staff with an environment that is conducive to learning. Any behavior that \\njeopardizes the maintenance of the campus or an individual's property may be reviewed \\nthrough the u niversity community standards process . Examples of violations of community \\nstandards in relation to property include, but are not limited to: \\n\\u2022 Damage to or destruction of property \\n\\u2022 Improper placement of posters/banners \\n\\u2022 Improper possession of property \\n\\u2022 Irresponsible use of university property or services \\n\\u2022 Operation of vehicles in restricted areas \\n\\u2022 Propping open doors that are kept locked for security purposes \\n\\u2022 Repairing and storing vehicles, motorized or otherwise, in unauthorized university spaces \\n\\u2022 Theft , including but not limited to by way of robbery, larceny, embezzlement or fraud \\n271 \\n \\n \\u2022 Trespassing on a roof, parapet, and/or other non- public areas \\n\\u2022 Unauthorized possession or use of keys or access cards \\n\\u2022 Unauthorized tapping into or altering university utility line s \\n\\u2022 Vandalism \\n\\u2022 Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Housing Services policies \\n\\u2022 Willful destruction of, disabling, or damaging computer facilities, equipment or software \\n \\nCarnegie Mellon has established basic guidelines that have been approved by students, staff \\nand faculty. These policies ensure the safe and functional operation of the university. Students \\nare expected to abide by these policies at all times. Failure to abide by these guidelines may be \\nreviewed through the university community standards process . Examples of violations of \\ncommunity standards in relation to health, safety and security include, but are not limited to: \\n\\u2022 Disorderly or disruptive behavior \\n\\u2022 Failure to comply with a reasonable request of a university official \\n\\u2022 Failure to comply with a request to produce identification \\n\\u2022 Failure to comply with university public health requirements or instructions \\n\\u2022 Failure to evacuate for fire drills and alarms \\n\\u2022 Harboring of an unauthorized animal(s) \\n\\u2022 Improper storage of chemicals, gases or hazardous materials \\n\\u2022 Installation of a private locking system \\n\\u2022 Possession or use of false identification \\n\\u2022 Tampering with or misuse of fire safety equipment \\n\\u2022 Unauthorized and/or unlawful recording \\n\\u2022 Unauthorized entry into secured spaces \\n\\u2022 Unauthorized use of appliances \\n\\u2022 Use of pyrotechnics, fireworks or hazardous devices \\n\\u2022 Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Alcohol and Drug Policy \\n\\u2022 Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Personal Wheeled Vehicle Transportation Policy \\n272 \\n \\n \\u2022 Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Housing Services Policies \\n\\u2022 Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Policy on Deadly Weapons \\n\\u2022 Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Policy on Freedom of Expression \\n\\u2022 Violation of the Carnegie Mellon University Smoke -Less Campus Policy \\nImportant Definitions \\n\\u2022 Adjudicator \\u2013 University official authorized to resolve allegations or impose outcomes for \\nstudents alleged to have violated community standards. This person is usually a housefellow \\nor college liaison, but the dean of students or designee may also act as an adjudicator . \\n\\u2022 Complainant \\u2013 The person(s) or group bringing allegations forward in the community \\nstandards process. In cases where there is no individual bringing forward an allegation, the university may act as complainant. Further, in cases where there is a community member \\nbringing forward an allegation, a university official may serve as co -complainant where the \\nuniversity determines that a broader community interest exists to safeguard the welfare of \\nthe university community and when the potential outcome in such a case could include \\nseparation from the university . \\n\\u2022 Hearing Officer \\u2013 The Hearing Officer is appointed by the dean of students or designee. A \\nHearing Officer may be an employee of Carnegie Mellon, or a third party engaged by the \\nuniversity, who has been trained to serve in this role. The Hearing Officer is responsible for conducting the hearing, making a determination regarding relevancy of in formation as well \\nas responsibility for each allegation. If applicable, the Hearing Officer will recommend outcomes to the Associate Vice President of Student Affairs for Community Life. \\n\\u2022 Moderator \\u2013 The Student Affairs staff member who facilitates a University Disciplinary \\nCommittee hearing. Moderators are appointed and trained by the Office of Community Standards & Integrity. The hearing runs at their discretion according to process guidelines . \\n\\u2022 Process Advisor \\u2013 As a member of the team in the Office of Community Standards & Integrity , \\nthe Process Advisor is responsible for the logistics of convening a University Disciplinary \\nCommittee. The Process Advisor schedules the hearing, assembles the hearing board, \\ninforms the complainant(s) and respondent(s) of the procedures for the hearing, and \\nmanages other administrative tasks . \\n\\u2022 Resolution \\u2013 Typically, the result of a complaint being adjudicated through the community \\nstandards process which may entail administrative resolution or the University Disciplinary \\n273 \\n \\n Committee. However, a complaint may be resolved informally outside of the community \\nstandards process at the discretion of the dean of students or designee and the individuals \\ninvolved in the matter . \\n\\u2022 Resolution Review Board \\u2013 The team of designated and trained staff that reviews and \\napproves initial allegations and determines appropriate venues for resolution through the \\ncommunity standards process. The Resolution Review Board also reviews and approves \\nproposed outcomes stemming from Administrative Resolution Meetings . \\n\\u2022 Respondent \\u2013 The person(s), group, or student organization alleged to have vi olated \\ncommunity standards . \\n\\u2022 Student \\u2013 Any person registered for, enrolled in, or auditing any course(s) at Carnegie Mellon \\nUniversity at the time of the alleged violation. For community standards purposes, an individual is also considered to be a student if they have accepted their offer of admission \\nand are not yet enrolled. Examples include, but are not limited to, students who are enrolled \\nbut not taking classes due to an academic break, medical leave, suspension, or other personal leave; students who were enrolled at the time of the incident; persons who \\ndemonstrate an intent to enroll by registering for courses; and students participating in study \\nabroad programs . \\n\\u2022 Support Person \\u2013 A person of the student's choosing who accompanies the student t o any \\nmeeting related to the community standards process, including a University Disciplinary Committee hearing. The role of the support person is limited to supporting the student in \\nmeetings or a hearing. Support persons may not actively participate in m eetings, the hearing \\nprocess or communicate on the student's behalf . \\n\\u2022 Witness \\u2013 Individuals positioned to provide direct information related to the alleged \\nviolations being reviewed by the University Disciplinary Committee, such as direct \\nobservation of the incident in question and/or direct interaction with \\nThe Community Standards Process \\nStaff members in the Division of Student Affairs adjudicate alleged violations of community \\nstandards by students through the community standards process. The following forums exist for \\nformal resolution of alleged violations: \\n\\u2022 Administrative Resolution Meeting with a university adjudicator \\n\\u2022 University Disciplinary Committee (UDC) \\n274 \\n \\n \\u2022 Hearing Officer \\n\\u2022 Academic Review Board (ARB) \\n For incidents that pose immediate concerns for the safety and welfare of the campus \\ncommunity, during the tendency of university community standards proceedings, the university may conduct a review per the Safety Intervention Protocol\\n to determine whether it is necessary \\nto take summary action or implement interim measures that limit a student's ability to be present on campus, engage in coursework, and/or interact with specific members of the university community until resolution is reached . \\nAdditionally, when circumstances warrant, the dean of students or designee may modify these procedures to ensure the safety and welfare of the campus community. \\nInitiating the Community Standards Process \\nIn order to initiate the community standards process, the Office of Community Standards & Integrity must receive a complaint or report that substantiates the facts and circumstances associate d with any alleged violation(s) of community standards by a Carnegie Mellon \\nstudent. The initial information for the complaint or report may be provided by a student, faculty, staff member, or non -affiliate directly to the Office of Community Standards & \\nIntegrity or via the following : \\n\\u2022 Campus Security Authority (as defined in the university\\u2019s \\nAnnual Security and Fire Safety \\nReport ); \\n\\u2022 Carnegie Mellon University\\u2019s Ethics Reporting Hotline ; \\n\\u2022 Carnegie Mellon University\\u2019s Bias Reporting Resources ; \\n\\u2022 Carnegie Mellon University Police Department ; \\n\\u2022 City of Pittsburgh Police and/or other law enforcement agency; \\n\\u2022 Information Security Office ; or \\n\\u2022 Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX . \\nThe O ffice of Community Standards & Integrity has the authority to review and adjudicate all \\nviolations of university standards, policies and regulations that involve students. The university community standards process may not be used for the adjudication of c ases \\ninvolving the relationships or interactions between two parties that do not involve alleged violations of community standards. Additionally, a complaint may be resolved informally \\n275 \\n \\n outside of the community standards process at the discretion of the dea n of students or \\ndesignee and with the agreement of the individuals involved in the matter . \\nAs needed the Resolution Review Board (RRB) is empowered to review initial complaints and \\ndetermine whether there is a reasonable basis for resolution via the community standards process. When reviewing a complaint, the Resolution Review Board will consider if the \\ndescribed behavior could violate a University policy or community standard if shown to be true. The RRB may determine the described behavior does not constitute a violation of community standards or the complaint does not contain enough information to make such a determination and may request additional information or further investigation. The RRB may dismiss a complaint when it is determined there is no r easonable basis for resolution via the \\ncommunity standards process . Complaints that are dismissed may be resolved via an \\ninformal process including, but not limited to, conflict coaching, facilitating a dialogue, mediation, restorative practices, or shuttle diplomacy. \\nStudent organizations, as members of the academic community, are expected to uphold \\nuniversity policies and community standards. Alleged violations of community standards associated with student organization activities may be reviewed through the community standards process. Individual students may be held accountable through the community standards process separate from any sanctions imposed on an organization found responsible for violating community standards . \\nWithdrawal of a Complaint \\nGenerally, when pending allegations are withdrawn by the complainant, the allegatio ns \\nmay not be refiled unless new information becomes available that was not previously available. The refiled complaint will be reviewed by the Resolution Review Board to determine if the allegations should move forward based on the current circumstances. For allegations of sexual misconduct involving student respondents under \\nSection VI.E of the sexual misconduct policy\\n (i.e. Other Prohibited Conduct), this \\nwithdrawal of complaint rule applies only after the final investigative report is provided to the Office of Community Standards & Integrity for adjudication through the community standards process . \\nEngagement Expectations \\nIt is an expectation that students involved in the community standards process make a good faith effort to participate and bring the matter to resolution . \\nIf a Complainant ceases to engage in the resolution process, the Resolution Review Board may elect to dismiss the allegations or the RRB may allow the allegations to proceed with \\n276 \\n \\n a university official serving as the Complainant. Allegations dismissed by RRB may not be \\nrefiled by the Complainant unless new information is available that was not previously \\navailable . \\nIf a Respondent cease s to participate in the process, the university may proceed to make a \\ndetermination via Administrative Resolution or schedule and conduct a University Disciplinary Committee without that student's participation . \\nOverriding Community Interest in Community S tandards Matters \\nThere are some circumstances in which an overriding community interest will necessitate engagement of the community standards process even if the impacted party does not wish to pursue it as a means of resolution. \\nThe Office of Community S tandards & Integrity in consultation with the Resolution Review \\nBoard will determine if an overriding community interest exists. The Title IX Coordinator will play a key role in determining the existence of an overriding community interest in cases involvi ng alleged violations of the \\nCarnegie Mellon Sexual Misconduct Policy \\n(Interim) . \\nIn circumstances where an impacted party does not wish to pursue action through the community sta ndards process and it is determined that an overriding community interest \\nexists, the University will bring the matter for review via the community standards \\nprocess. The impacted party will be informed of this decision as well as their options for \\nparticipation in the resolution process. \\nAdministrative Resolution Meeting \\nA student is expected to meet with a university adjudicator to attempt to resolve alleged violation(s) of university community standards. A successful administrative resolution meeting wil l include the following : \\n1. The facts must be determined. The student must agree that essential facts related to the \\nincident are undisputed. \\n2. A violation of community standards must be determined. The student must agree that \\nwhat occurred during the incident was a violation of the university's community \\nstandards. \\n3. A proposed outcome or set of outcomes must be determined. The student and \\nadjudicator must jointly agree about what outcome or set of outcomes will be proposed \\n277 \\n \\n for resolution of the matter, taking into account where appropriate the concerns of the \\nreporting party . \\nThe aforementioned proposed outcome or set of outcomes will be reviewed by the \\nResolution Review Board. If approved, the student will receive notification in writing confirming the determined action, which then becomes final. If agreement on the appropriate action cannot be reached, the matter may be referred to the University Disciplinary Committee for review . \\n Should a student be non- responsive to notification of an alleged violati on of the university's \\ncommunity standards, after a reasonable period of time and having made reasonable attempts to contact the Respondent, the university adjudicator may make a determination regarding responsibility and assign restorative outcomes and/or a period of disciplinary \\nprobation based on the information available. Consistent with Administrative Resolution procedures, this determination will be forwarded to the Resolution Review Board for approval. Violations that may result in disciplinary suspe nsion and where the student is non-\\nresponsive will be referred to the University Disciplinary Committee for resolution . \\nUniversity Disciplinary Committee \\nThe University Disciplinary Committee has jurisdiction in the following cases: \\n1. Any cases of alleged violations of university standards and policies that the Resolution \\nReview Board deems sufficiently serious in nature or inappropriate for administrative \\nresolution. \\n2. Any cases of alleged violations of university standards and policies in which one \\nstudent(s) is filing allegation against another student(s) that cannot be appropriately \\nresolved through the administrative resolution process . \\n3. Appeals referred by the dean of students or designee to review summary actions \\nimposed by a university adjudicator or university staff member . \\n4. Cases in which administrative resolution has not been successful. \\nWhen circumstances warrant, at the discretion of the Dean of Students or designee, a case \\nmay be reviewed by a Hearing Officer in lieu of the University Disciplinary Co mmittee. In such \\ncases, the procedures outlined in Conduct of University Disciplinary Committee Hearings will \\nbe utilized. \\n278 \\n \\n Composition of the University Disciplinary Committee \\nEach case presented to the University Disciplinary Committee is heard by two student \\nboard members, one staff board member, one faculty board member and one additional faculty or staff board member. In addition, a trained moderator will preside o ver the \\nhearing . \\nThe faculty members will be appointed by the Office of Community Standards & \\nIntegrity in consultation with Faculty Senate. The staff members will be appointed by the \\nOffice of the Community Standards & Integrity in consultation with Staf f Council. The \\nstudent members will be appointed by the Office of Community Standards & Integrity in \\nconsultation with Undergraduate Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly following a selection process coordinated by the Office of Community Stand ards & \\nIntegrity. All appointees must complete initial and ongoing training in order to be eligible to serve as board members. Once trained, board members may complete up to three years of service. Board members may be reappointed to successive three year terms . \\nMembers participating in a given hearing will be selected from a list of eligible individuals based upon availability and disinterestedness in the case or parties following review by the parties who are appearing before the University Disciplinary C ommittee. The following \\ncircumstance would preclude participation as a board member in a given hearing : \\n\\u2022 Individuals with prior substantial knowledge of or interest in the student(s) involved or \\nthe event(s) leading to the allegations . \\n\\u2022 Individuals with a conflict of interest with the student(s), witnesses or other parties to \\nthe case . \\n\\u2022 Individuals who may appropriately be a witness in the case . \\nConduct of University Disciplinary Committee Hearings \\nThe university attempts to ensure fair, timely and orderly procedures in all community \\nstandards reviews. To provide for this, the university has adopted the following procedural protections that govern the University Disciplinary Committee process : \\nHearing Preparation and Scheduling \\n1. The logistics of hearing preparation and scheduling will be coordinated by a process \\nadvisor in the Office of Community Standards & Integrity . \\n2. The student must be notified in writing of the specific policy, standard or regulation \\nthe student has allegedly violated. S uch notification is normally made at least seven \\ncalendar days before the hearing . \\n279 \\n \\n 3. Throughout the community standards process, the student respondent will receive \\nfull notification of complaint, notification of any hearing and notification of \\ndisposition o f the charge and will have the opportunity to be present throughout the \\nhearing process . \\n4. The complainant will receive full notification of the complaint, notification of any \\nhearing, and will have the opportunity to be present throughout the hearing proces s. \\n5. Prior to the hearing, the individuals involved will be asked if they believe that the \\npotential hearing board members are aware of any significant relationship or interaction that might impair their ability to render an objective recommendation for resolution of the matter under review. The process advisor will consider this in seating the board for \\nthe hearing . \\n6. Written introductions are an opportunity for either party to offer their initial thoughts \\nand general sentiments about th e allegations under review by the University \\nDisciplinary Committee . \\n7. During process advisement, the complainant and respondent will be provided a hearing packet, which may include, among other relevant items: the initial complainant report; any investigation reports and/or witness statements; a written \\nintroduction from the complainant(s) to the board; and a written introduction from \\nthe respondent(s) to the board. This packet may be used for the purpose of \\npreparing for or use during the hearing, consiste nt with the privacy rights of those \\ninvolved. These materials are to be kept private and may be shared only with \\npermission from the process advisor. These documents may not be duplicated nor \\nutilized for any other purpose . \\n8. In advance of the hearing, the m embers of the University Disciplinary Committee will \\nbe provided a hearing packet, which may include, among other relevant items: the \\ninitial complainant report; any investigation reports and/or witness statements; a written introduction from the complaina nt(s) to the board; and a written introduction \\nfrom the respondent(s) to the board. Board members are expected to keep the information reviewed during a University Disciplinary Committee confidential. \\n9. Complainant(s) and respondent(s) may submit up to three written letters of support \\nat a date specified by the process advisor for consideration only during the outcomes phase of the proceeding in the event that the respondent is found responsible . \\n280 \\n \\n 10. It is the responsibility of the Office of Community Standards & Integrity to ensure that \\ntimes set for hearings are reasonable and that necessary accommodations have been \\noffered to both the complainant and respondent whenever appropriate. In turn, both \\nthe complainant and respondent will be expected to dem onstrate good faith efforts in \\ntheir participation with this process, particularly in relation to the scheduling of the hearing. In a case involving exigent circumstances that prevent the complainant or respondent from participating in a scheduled hearing, the hearing will be rescheduled. \\n11. Every effort will be made to avoid conflicts with a student's class schedule when identifying a hearing date and time. When circumstances warrant, classroom \\nattendance, except for scheduled examinations, will not be a reas onable excuse for \\ndelaying a hearing . \\n12. In the rare circumstance where a respondent fails to make a good faith effort to participate in the process, the university (having made reasonable attempts to \\naccommodate the respondent) may elect to schedule and cond uct a hearing without \\nthat student's participation . \\n13. Review of incidents involving both community standards allegations and academic integrity allegations may be conducted by a University Disciplinary Committee at the \\ndiscretion of the dean of students or designee. \\n14. Allegations stemming from multiple incidents indicating an alleged pattern of behavior \\nmay be collectively reviewed by a single University Disciplinary Committee at the \\ndiscretion of the Resolution Review Board . \\n15. The respondent may file in writing counter -allegations against the complainant in \\nconnection with the incident(s) currently under review by the University Disciplinary \\nCommittee. In order to be considered for inclusion in the packet in the same hearing process, counter -allegations must be r aised within a reasonable time (normally two \\nbusiness days) of the first University Disciplinary Committee process advisement meeting. The counter -allegations must detail the university regulation or policy that the \\nrespondent believes has been violated in connection with the incident(s) currently under \\nreview by the University Disciplinary Committee and provide information that substantiates the facts and circumstances. Counter -allegations cannot be based solely \\non the fact that a complaint was brought for ward, nor can they be retaliatory in nature. \\nThe Resolution Review Board will determine if the counter -allegations will be reviewed \\n281 \\n \\n by the University Disciplinary Committee or resolved in a subsequent hearing, based on \\nthe connection of the counter - allega tions to the incident(s) already under review . \\n16. Both the complainant and respondent have the right to have one Support Person of their choosing present at the hearing. Both parties are required to notify the process \\nadvisor of their Support Person of choice at a date specified by the process advisor that \\nwill be at least three days in advance. If legal counsel will serve in this capacity, a \\nrepresentative of the University\\u2019s Office of General Counsel will typically be present for \\nthe hearing to provide assis tance to the University Disciplinary Committee, moderator, \\nand/or process advisor as needed. Legal counsel or any other Support Person, if present, will not be permitted to participate in the proceedings but may advise the \\nrespondent or the complainant and /or be present at a hearing. In the event that one \\nparty to a case is accompanied by legal counsel without advance notice, a hearing may \\nbe postponed until all parties to the case have had an opportunity to have counsel \\npresent. Registered Support Persons are not permitted to participate as witnesses in the same hearing . \\n17. Both the complainant and respondent have the opportunity to register witnesses. Witnesses should be able to provide direct information related to the alleged violations \\nbeing reviewed by th e University Disciplinary Committee, such as direct observation of \\nthe incident in question and/or direct interaction with any of the parties before, during \\nor after the incident in question. Both parties are required to notify the process advisor \\nof their registered witnesses at a date specified by the process advisor that will be at \\nleast three days in advance of the University Disciplinary Committee hearing . \\n18. The university reserves the right to supplement the registered witness list at any time to \\nensure that the board has access to all potential witnesses with substantive information. \\nBoth the Complainant and Respondent will be promptly notified of any changes to the \\nregistered witness list . \\n19. In scheduling a hearing, consideration should be given to allow that witnesses significant \\nto the case being heard are available to the hearing group. If a witness is not available to \\nbe called by the hearing group in person or via telecommunication, they may submit a written statement to the process advisor to be rev iewed if the board requests \\ninformation from the witness . \\n282 \\n \\n Hearing Process and Procedures \\n1. Information provided during a University Disciplinary Committee hearing should \\nremain private . \\n2. In order to maintain a fair and equitable process, no new materials will be accepted on the day of the hearing, with the exception of (i) oral testimony and (ii) such other \\ninformation as may be necessary to rebut new oral testimony. Information offered as rebuttal will only be accepted at the discretion of the moderator . \\n3. All proceedings before a hearing group, except the deliberation of the group, will be recorded. Recordings will be kept in accordance with community standards records \\nretention practices . \\n4. During the actual hearing, a student has the right to be present when \\ninformation relative to the case is being presented. In the community standards process, \\na student who is charged with a violation has the right to remain silent. \\n5. The moderator will remind all persons present at the opening of each community \\nstandards hearin g that the purpose of a University Disciplinary Committee is to \\ndetermine an appropriate response, through a deliberative process, when a violation of policy, standard or regulation is alleged. \\n6. The complainant(s) and respondent(s) will each be limited to ten minutes for their introduction . \\n7. The majority of the proceeding will consist of questioning from the board members for \\nall parties as well as the registered witnesses that are called by the board. The \\ncomplainant(s) and respondent(s) will also have the opportunity to present questions for \\nthe board\\u2019s consideration . \\n8. It is within the discretion of the board to determine whether they wish to hear from \\nthe registered witnesses. Witnesses will be questioned one at a time by the hearing \\ngroup and s ubsequently dismissed. They should only be present in the room when \\nproviding information to the board. Except in documented extenuating circumstances, students are expected to make a good faith effort to provide \\ninformation to the University Disciplinary Committee when called as a witness . \\n9. The complainant(s) and respondent(s) will each be limited to five minutes for their \\nsummary . \\n283 \\n \\n 10. All materials provided to the complainant(s) and respondent(s) (including those provided \\nelectronically ) must be returned to the process advisor at the conclusion of the hearing . \\nCopies of these materials may not be retained or used for any other purpose. \\n11. Following the complainant and respondent summary, the board will enter closed \\ndeliberations. A more likely than not standard (preponderance of the evidence) will \\nbe used to determine if a university policy, standard or regulation was violated. If responsibility is determined, the board will make a recommendation for appropriate \\noutcomes . \\n12. No information about a respondent's prior community standards record will be shared with the University Disciplinary Committee until a determination of responsibility has \\nbeen made unless the case being reviewed stems from the prior incident for which a community standards record exists. If a respondent(s) has a prior community standards \\nrecord and is found responsible by the University Disciplinary Committee, the following information will be shared with the board: community standards violation(s) for which they were found responsible, d ate of incident(s), brief summary, outcome(s), and status \\nof the case(s). The student may be recalled before the board to discuss the prior violations and outcomes prior to the University Disciplinary Committee making a \\nrecommendation for appropriate outco mes for the present case . \\nHearing Outcome Determination and Notifications \\n16. A representative of the Office of Community Standards & Integrity will be responsible \\nfor notifying the associate vice president of student affairs for community life or \\ndesignee in writing of the recommendation of the hearing group regarding \\nresponsibility and any outcomes deemed appropriate . \\n17. The associate vice president of student affairs for community life or designee makes the decision in the case, informed by the recommendation of the University \\nDisciplinary Committee. The associate vice president of student affairs for \\ncommunity life or designee may accept, reject, or modify the recommendation, or \\nmay remand the matter to a new University Disciplinary Committee for review . \\n18. After reviewing the recommendations, the associate vice president of student affairs \\nfor community life or designee will render a decision in writing. The decision letter will typically be delivered to the respondent(s) by the process advisor . \\n19. In cases that inv olve a) crimes of violence and non- forcible sex offenses as defined by \\nthe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and b) sexual assault, dating \\n284 \\n \\n violence, domestic violence, and stalking in accordance with the Violence Against \\nWomen Act (VAWA), t he complainant/ impacted party will receive notification of \\ndisposition of the allegation(s) . \\n20. Parents of a student normally will not be notified of any community standards action . \\n21. Community standards actions will be recorded in the student's education rec ord in the \\nOffice of Community Standards & Integrity in accordance with community standards records retention practices. When community standards actions affect eligibility for \\nenrollment, designation on other university records will be made. Community sta ndards \\nrecords will not be released as a part of the official transcript of the academic record of a student . \\nAppeals \\nA request for appeal of a decision delivered through the University Disciplinary \\nCommittee process must be submitted in writing to the pre sident of the university by the \\nrespondent within seven calendar days of the official notification of the decision . \\nIn cases where the disposition of the charge has been communicated to the complainant and/or impacted party ( as described above ), the compla inant and/or impacted party may \\nalso submit a request for appeal in writing to the president of the university within seven calendar days of the official notification of the decision . \\nThe written appeal request should indicate whether the student is appealing the finding(s) of responsibility, the outcome(s), or both, as well as the basis for the appeal itself. The basis of an appeal will be limited to one or more of the following cases : \\n\\u2022 A gross procedural error that materially affected the outcome ; \\n\\u2022 The outcome(s) imposed were not commensurate with the violation(s) of community \\nstandards for which the respondent(s) were found responsible ; \\n\\u2022 The finding was not consistent with a preponderance of the evidence ; \\n\\u2022 New information, which was unavailable at the tim e of the hearing, that merits re -\\nconsideration of the final disposition . \\nThe appeal officer designated by the president will review the written appeal request and \\ndetermine whether, in the judgment of the appeal officer, sufficient grounds exist for at \\nleast one basis of appeal to be further explored through review by the appeal officer. In \\nhearing an appeal, the appeal officer, at their discretion, may meet with individuals and review information relevant to the bases of the appeal. In the event of an appe al process, \\n285 \\n \\n outcomes will normally be held in abeyance pending the resolution of the appeal, except \\nin cases where the university determines there may exist a threat to the safety and welfare of the campus community, in which case outcomes will take immedi ate effect. \\nInterim measures put in place via the Safety Intervention Protocol\\n are not outcomes and \\ntherefore remain in effect per their original terms during the pendency of the appeal. \\nAppeals will be decided by the appeal officer in a timely manner as circumstances warrant. While an appeal is under review, the appeal officer will update the respondent(s) and complainant(s) as necessary about the anticipated timeline . \\nThe appeal officer has the authority to modify the decision as they deem appropriate for resolution of the matter being appealed, which could entail an increase, decrease or change to the nature of the outcome (s). The appeal officer may als o reconvene the initial \\nUniversity Disciplinary Committee or remand the matter to a new University Disciplinary Committee for review . \\nCases Involving Prohibited Conduct Under Section VI.E of the Sexual Miscon duct \\nPolicy (Interim) \\nAlleged violations of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) that meet the definition of \\nFederal Rule Sexual Misconduct will be resolved in accordance with the Hearing \\nProcedures for the Adjudication of Federal Rule Sexual Misconduct set forth in Section \\nVI.C of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) . Cases involving Other Prohibited Conduct \\nwith student respo ndents under section VI.E of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) will \\nbe resolved in accordance with the Community Standards process subject to the following \\nadditional procedures. \\n1. In cases where the university receives information describing behaviors that may \\nviolate the university Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) and the impacted party \\nchooses not to serve as a complainant in a community standards proceeding, the \\nuniversity may act as a complainant when there exists a broader or overriding \\ncommunity interest. Notwithstanding the fact that the impacted party wishes no t to \\nserve as complainant, they may nevertheless act as a witness in a University Disciplinary Committee hearing . \\n2. For all Prohibited Conduct, students may utilize alternative resolution options for \\ntheir complaint as set forth in Section VI.G of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) . \\n3. In cases involving alleged violations of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) , the \\nuniversity will register the appropriate university investigator(s) to serve as potential witnesses during a University Disciplinary Committee hearing . \\n286 \\n \\n 4. Expert witnesses may testify before the University Disciplinary C ommittee only as \\nspecified in Appendix B of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) . \\n5. In general, new information will not be added to the investigative report under VI.B of \\nthe Sexual Misconduct Policy (Interim) . The Process Advisor has discretion to allow \\nnew documentary evidence prior to a hearing or to remand the matter back to the investigator for further investigation. \\n6. In cases that involve a) crimes of violence and non- forcible sex offenses as defined by \\nthe F amily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and b) sexual assault, dating \\nviolence, domestic violence, and stalking in accordance with the Violence Against \\nWomen Act (VAWA), the complainant/impacted party will receive notification of \\ndisposition of the allegation(s) and has the right to submit an appeal following notification of the disposition of a complaint resolved by a University Disciplinary \\nCommittee. \\n7. After reviewing the recommendations, the associate vice president of student affairs \\nfor community life or designee will notify the respondent in writing of their decision \\nas well as the process for appeal. Notifications to the complainant/impacted party in \\ncases that involve a) crimes of violence and non- forcible sex offenses as defined by \\nthe Fami ly Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and b) sexual assault, dating \\nviolence, domestic violence, and stalking in accordance with the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) will be made in writing by the process advisor and will include \\nnotification of t he appeal process . \\n8. Administrative resolution meetings and University Disciplinary Committee hearings will be conducted by officials who receive annual training on the issues related to all \\nProhibited Conduct on how to conduct an investigation and hearing process that protects the safety of all involved while promoting accountability and a fair process . \\nCases Involving Student Organizations \\nCarnegie Mellon University is committed to managing all cases that involve alleged \\nviolations of university policy by s tudent organizations with appropriate care and \\nsensitivity. In these cases, the university may need to invoke additional procedural provisions to determine responsibility for alleged policy violation(s) by a student organization. Recognized student organizations include groups that are given recognition \\nby a college, department or governing body on campus. Recognized student organizations have certain privileges and use of campus resources (e.g. funding (university or student \\n287 \\n \\n fees), use of designated spaces , participation in campus activities, ability to utilize \\nuniversity systems, etc) . \\nIn cases of alleged policy violations in which the responding party is a student \\norganization, the following procedures will supplement the procedures outlined in the Conduct of University Disciplinary Committee Hearings : \\n1. In cases where the university receives information describing behaviors that may \\nviolate university policy and the impacted party chooses not to serve as a \\ncomplainant in a community standards proceeding, the university may act as a \\ncomplainant when there exists a broader or overriding community interest. \\nNotwithstanding the fact that the impacted party wishes not to serve as complainant, \\nthey may nevertheless act as a witness in a University Disciplinary Committee \\nhearing . \\n2. In cases where the university receives information describing behaviors that may \\nviolate university policy, the university reserves the right to temporarily restrict any \\nand all activities and operations of the organization wh ile the case is being \\ninvestigated and/or resolved through the appropriate process . \\n3. For purposes of organizational conduct, separation from the university may be defined as temporary or permanent loss of recognition along with associated \\nprivileges . \\n4. No more than two student members may represent an organization in a community standards proceeding . \\n5. The University Disciplinary Committee may review both individual member and \\norganizational allegations concurrently. It is recommended that members \\nresponding to individual allegations do not also represent the organization in the \\nsame University Disciplinary Committee . \\n6. A preponderance of the evidence standard (e.g., more likely than not) will be used to \\ndetermine if a university policy, standard, or regulation ha s been violated. \\n7. Administrative resolution meetings will be conducted by the SLICE representative or designee for alleged violations of community standards by an organization. Should \\nadministrative resolution fail, the matter will be remanded to the Office of \\nCommunity Standards & Integrity for resolution . \\n8. The complaining party and each designated student representative is entitled to a copy of the board packet before the hearing . \\n288 \\n \\n 9. The university is committed to resolving cases related to organizational conduct in a \\ntimely manner. Complainants and respondents will receive periodic status updates \\nrelated to the timeline for resolution of the case . \\n10. The university reserves the right to share periodic updates related to process, timeline, findings, and resolution of the case with appropriate parties including \\norganization advisors, the sponsoring academic unit, (inter)national organization \\nheadquarters, and/or recognizing body (e.g. Student Government or appropriate \\nGoverning Councils), etc . \\n11. Unless a different timeline is set forth in this section, stated timelines for a University Disciplinary Committee hearing and notification of a decision will be followed in \\ncases involving student organizations . \\n12. Upon a finding of responsibility, the University Dis ciplinary Committee or \\nadjudicator will be provided with the student organization\\u2019s prior community \\nstandards violations (four years prior) for consideration when determining outcomes . \\nThe student organization representatives may be recalled before the boa rd to \\ndiscuss the prior violations and outcomes prior to the University Disciplinary Committee making a recommendation for appropriate outcomes for the present \\ncase. The complainant may be recalled with the student organization representatives. \\n13. The Univers ity Disciplinary Committee may recommend as an outcome of the \\norganizational review, that an individual or individuals be charged with specific policy violations to be reviewed via a subsequent community standards process . \\n14. In cases that involve student org anizations, complaints will be considered for a \\nperiod of four years following the date of the most recent allegation. Complaints \\nreceived more than two years following the date of the most recent allegation may \\nbe reviewed upon the approval of the Associate Vice President for Community \\nStandards and Diversity Initiatives . \\n15. In cases that involve student organizations, the complainant will receive notification \\nof disposition of the allegation(s) to the degree that individual privacy is not impacted. \\n16. After re viewing the recommendations, the associate vice president of student affairs \\nfor community life or designee will render a decision in writing. The decision letter \\nwill typically be delivered to the respondent(s) by the process advisor . \\n289 \\n \\n 17. Appeals will be decided by the appeal officer in a timely manner as circumstances \\nwarrant. While an appeal is under review, the appeal officer will update the \\nrespondent and complainant as necessary about the anticipated timeline. The \\ncomplainant and respondent will be notifi ed in writing of the final decision . \\n18. Consistent with Pennsylvania state law, the university will issue and electronically publish a biannual report of all reported hazing violations. Biannual hazing reports are retained for at least five years . \\n19. Community s tandards records of student organizations are retained for a period of \\nseven years following the conclusion of the resolution process. The record may \\nbe maintained indefinitely if a student organization has not fulfilled all outcomes or \\nhas not resolved pe nding community standards allegations. Records of community \\nstandards processes that result in the temporary loss of recognition from the university will be maintained for a period of seven years after the organization \\nreceives recognition once the suspens ion period has concluded. Records of \\ncommunity standards processes that result in the permanent loss of recognition \\nfrom the university will be maintained indefinitely . \\nOutcomes \\nThe community standards outcomes defined below comprise a range of official ac tion that \\nmay be imposed by the University for violations of community standards. One or more of \\nthese actions may be imposed in response to a given situation. This list is not comprehensive, as other outcomes may be utilized as appropriate. \\nWhen outcomes are decided as part of the community standards process, the educational and developmental needs of the involved student and the welfare of the community will be considered with utmost importance. The outcomes categories (i.e. student status, restorative and restrictive) are intended to clarify the role and purpose of the various actions. The \\ndetermination of outcomes will be guided by the following considerations: the interests of the community, the impact of the violation, documented community standards hi story, and \\nany mitigating or aggravating circumstances . \\nNon- compliance with imposed or agreed- upon outcomes may result in further action \\nthrough the community standards process. Students with two (2) community standards violations within and academic year may immediately be placed in disciplinary probation. \\nStudent involved in three (3) violation within an academic year may be referred to the University Disciplinary Committee . \\n290 \\n \\n Outcomes Related to Student Standing \\nThese outcomes clarify the student\\u2019s standing with the University. Additional violations of \\ncommunity standards may result in more severe outcomes including separation from the University . \\n\\u2022 Warning: For minor infractions, a student may be issued a written warning. The \\nwarning will be noted in the event of any further infractions of community standards \\nand may justify consideration of more severe outcomes. While a warning may \\ninfluence future actions r elated to student standing, a warning alone does not affect \\nstudent standing. \\n\\u2022 Residential Probation: An official notice to a residential student that conduct with \\nregard to university housing regulations or policies has been unacceptable and that \\nfuture violation of university regulations may result in more serious community \\nstandards action, including the possible loss of campus residency. Probation lasts for a \\nstated period of time. \\n\\u2022 Disciplinary Probation: For a second infraction or for a single offense of a more serious \\nnature, a student may be placed on disciplinary probation for a designated period of time, during which subsequent community standards violations may result in \\nsuspension or expulsion. A student on probation is still considered to be in good standing with the university . \\n\\u2022 Disciplinary Suspension: A student may be barred from enrollment for a designated \\nperiod of time. Students who have been suspended are required to absent themselves \\nfrom the campus (including but not limited to university housing, fraternity or sorority \\nhouses, offices, labs, and libraries) within a maximum of two days after the action and \\nto remain off the campus for the duration of the time specified as outlined in the \\nPolicy on Student Suspension/Required Withdrawal . A student on disciplinary \\nsuspension is not eligible to register for courses, attend classes, live in university \\nhousing, use campus facilities, be on university propert y, participate in student \\nactivities, be an active member of a student organization, or be employed by the \\nuniversity during the period of suspension . \\n\\u2022 Expulsion: The student is required to sever entirely their connection with the \\nuniversity. Students who have been expelled are required to absent themselves from \\nuniversity property (including but not limited to university housing, fraternity or \\nsorority houses , offices, labs, and libraries) within a maximum of two days after the \\n291 \\n \\n action and to remain off the campus permanently. Students who have been expelled \\nfrom the university may not apply for admission to other academic programs at the \\nuniversity. \\nRestorative Outcomes \\nThese outcomes require the student to take action to repair the harm their behavior \\ncause d or to utilize university resources to support their continued engagement in the \\ncommunity. Failure to complete these outcomes by the specified deadline may result in additio nal community standards action. \\n\\u2022 Behavioral Assessments and Recommendations: The University may require a student \\nto meet with a health care provider and/or a mental health care provider within a \\nspecified time frame. If so, the student will be expected to fully participate in any \\nrelevant assessment requested by the provider and complete any consequent \\nrecommendation(s), such as a treatment plan or a referral to another provider. The \\nstudent is expected to provide the appropriate releases to allow the university to \\nconfirm compliance with this outcome . \\n\\u2022 Community Service: The U niversity may require uncompensated service (a specified \\nnumber of hours) to the university or an off -campus, non- profit organization as a n \\noutcome . The particular assignment of duties must be pre - approved through the \\nappropriate university adjudicator. Students must provide appropriate documentation verifying their completed community service. Failure to complete the service \\nsatisfactorily within the specified period of time may result in further action through the community standards proces s. \\n\\u2022 Educational/Developmental Assignment: The University may require a student to \\ncomplete a project, assignment, or activity to promote the student\\u2019s education and \\ndevelopment. These assignments are at the discretion of the university adjudicator or \\nUniver sity Disciplinary Committee. Assignments may include but are not limited to: \\nreflection or research paper, development of a presentation, discussion with an individual, apology letter, reading assignment, etc . \\n\\u2022 Restitution: In cases where a student is found responsible for damaging or \\nmisappropriating physical property, the student may be responsible for reimbursing \\nthe property owner for all or some of the cost . \\nIn limited circumstances when a complaint was filed prior to the respondent\\u2019s degree \\nconferral, the dean of students or designee may consider the following outcomes: \\n292 \\n \\n \\u2022 Suspension of a conferred degree: A previously conferred degree is being suspended and \\nthe transcript will no longer reflect a completed degree. The degree will remain \\nsuspended until the time specified and any pending outcomes are completed. During the \\nduration of the degree suspension, the individual is prohibited from: representing that they have obtained a degree from Carnegie Mellon University; enrolling at Carnegie Mellon University; being present on University property; or participating in any Carnegie Mellon University sponsored events or activities, including alumni events.\\n \\n\\u2022 Revocation of a conferred degree: A previously conferred degree is being revoked and the \\ntranscript will no longer reflect a completed degree. The individual is prohibited from: representing that they have obtained a degree from Carnegie Mellon University; enrolling at Carnegie Mellon University in the future; being present on University property; or participating in any Carnegie Mellon University sponsored events or activities, including \\nalumni events. \\nRestrictive Outcomes \\nThese outcomes prevent a student from engaging in certain activities, being present in certain spaces or engaging with individuals during a specific time period. Violation of a \\nrestriction may lead to additional community standards action . \\n\\u2022 Loss of Privilege: Students may lose specified privileges, which may include access to \\nfacilities, services, and/or the opportunity to participate in university activities. \\n\\u2022 Loss of Residency in University Housing: An action that excludes a student or student \\ngroup from residence in university housing for a stated period of time. A student who \\nloses residency in university housing shall be considered for future housing accommodations once the period of debarment is concluded and as space permits. \\n\\u2022 No Contact Order: A No Contact Order is a directive from an associate vice president of \\nstudent affairs or designee indicating that two students may not have direct contact \\nwith each other, or make indirect contact through third parties, except for that which is \\nnecessary for their academic pursuits. A No Contact Order may be issued in connection with the community standards process, either as an interim measure \\nduring the pendency of the process and/or an outcome associated with a finding of \\nresponsibility from the process . \\n\\u2022 Room Reassignment: An action where a student is assigned to either another room in \\nthe same house community or a room in another house community. When a student is assigned to another house community, specific restrictions concerning the previous \\ncommunity may be invoked. \\n293 \\n \\n \\nWithholding a Degree \\nBecause a degree from the university signifies not only successful completion of academic \\nrequirements but also compliance with the university\\u2019s standards and good standing as a \\nmember of the university community, the dean of students or designee may direct that a degree not be certified by the university registrar and therefore not awarded pending the \\nresolution of community standards proceedings, including completion of all outcomes . \\nCitations \\nState citations are issued by University Police for violations of state law. While these \\ncitations are handled through the criminal justice system, students may also be expected to \\nmeet with a university adjudicator to determine whether a violation of community standards has also occur red. \\nWithdrawal with Pending Allegations \\nStudents who withdraw from the university with unresolved community standards allegations should expect the university to adjudicate the matter to bring the case to resolution and uphold the university\\u2019s obligation to expressly articulate eligibility to return to the university. If a good faith effort to participate in the appropriate process is not exhibited by the respondent, the university may elect to resolve the matter through the community standards process without that student's participation . \\nReview After a Charge or Conviction of a Crime \\nIn circumstances that constitute a potential threat to the safety and security of the university community and/or to the university\\u2019s ability to function in whole or in part, the university may \\nreview a case when a student has been charged with or convicted of any felony or misdemeanor crime(s) in federal, state, or local court or an equivalent foreign court. The review will be conducted utilizing the university's com munity standards process and/or \\nSafety Intervention Protocol\\n. \\nExamples of crimes that may trigger such review include but are not limited to: \\n\\u2022 Aggravated assault \\n\\u2022 Arson \\n\\u2022 Burglary \\n294 \\n \\n \\u2022 Child a buse \\n\\u2022 Criminal mischief \\n\\u2022 Hazing \\n\\u2022 Murder or manslaughter \\n\\u2022 Rape \\n\\u2022 Robbery \\n\\u2022 Sexual assault \\n\\u2022 Theft \\n\\u2022 The manufacturing, selling or possessing with intent to sell any drug on the prescribed \\nlist subject to the criminal code of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \\nCommunity Standards Records Retention and Reporting \\nRecords of community standards proceedings are confidential and are not released without the \\nconsent of the current/former student or as otherwise required or authorized by law or court order. With the ex ceptions as noted below, records of community standards proceedings are \\nretained for either the period of time required under the federal Clery Act (which in most cases is six to seven years after the date the incident was reported to the university), or three years after final separation of the student from the university, whichever is longer. For purposes of determining final separation from the university, a student must be separated for three continuous years. If a student re -enrolls in any student prog ram within three years, the \\ncalculation of the final separation date will reset. \\nConsistent with the Student Privacy Rights Policy\\n, for purposes of community standards record \\nchecks, information from these records is only provided, with appropriate authorization as necessary, for three years after final separation from the university (as defined abo ve) provided \\nthe student has fulfilled all obligations to the university. \\nThe file may be maintained indefinitely and reported longer than three years after the student separates from the university if a student has not fulfilled all obligations or has not resolved a pending Community Standards violation. \\nRecords of community standards proceedings resulting in the permanent separation of a student from the university (e.g., expulsion) will be maintained and reported indefinitely. \\n295 \\n \\n \\nCase- specific questions regarding timeframes for community standards records retention and \\nreporting can be directed to the Office of Community Standards & Integrity . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nStudent Resources \\n \\n296 \\n \\n \\n \\nAppendix: Student Resources \\n \\n\\u2022 Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: https://www.cmu.edu/student-\\ndiversity/index.html \\n\\u2022 The CMU Pantry: https://www .cmu.edu/student -affairs/resources/cmu -pantry/index.html \\n\\u2022 Office of Community Standards and Integrity (OCSI): http://www.cmu.edu/student-\\naffairs/ocsi/ \\n\\u2022 Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS): https://www.cmu.edu/counseling/ \\n\\u2022 Resources for Current Students: https://www.cmu.edu/current -students/index.html \\n\\u2022 Office of the Dean of Students: https://www.cmu.edu/student-\\naffairs/dean/loans/index.html \\n\\u2022 Office of Disability Resources: https://www.cmu.edu/disability -resources/ \\n\\u2022 Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity: https://www.cmu.edu/drbc/ \\n\\u2022 Facilities Management and Campus Services (FMCS): https://www.cmu.edu/fmcs/ \\n\\u2022 General Counsel: https://www.cmu.edu/ogc/ \\n\\u2022 Graduate Education: https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/ \\n297 \\n \\n \\u2022 The HUB: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/ \\n\\u2022 Office of International Education (OIE): http://www.cmu.edu/oie/ \\n\\u2022 Legal Consultation: https://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/resources/legal -\\nconsultation.html \\n\\u2022 Religious and Spiritual Life Initiatives: https://www.cmu.edu/student -\\naffairs/spirituality/index.html \\n\\u2022 Research Integrity & Compliance: https://www.cmu.edu/research -compliance/ \\n\\u2022 Student Affairs: https://www.cmu.edu/student- affairs/ \\n\\u2022 Student Government: https://www.cmu.edu/stugov/ \\n\\u2022 Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX : https://www.cmu.edu/title -ix/ \\n\\u2022 Undergraduate Catalog: http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/ \\n\\u2022 University Brand Standards: https://www.cmu.edu/marcom/br and-standards/ \\n\\u2022 University Health Services (UHS): http://www.cmu.edu/health -services/index.html \\n\\u2022 University Police: https://www.cmu.edu/police/ \\n\\u2022 University Policies: https://www.cmu.edu/policies/ \\n\\u2022 Vice Provost for Education: https://www.cmu.edu/education- office/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
